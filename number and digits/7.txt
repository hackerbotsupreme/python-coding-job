You are given two positive integer value n and s. You have to find the total number of such integer from 1 to n such that the difference of integer and its digit sum is greater than given s.
Examples : 
 

Input : n = 20, s = 5
Output :11
Explanation : Integer from 1 to 9 have 
diff(integer - digitSum) = 0 but for 10 to 
20 they have diff(value - digitSum) > 5

Input : n = 20, s = 20
Output : 0
Explanation : Integer from 1 to 20 have diff
(integer - digitSum) >  5
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The very first and basic approach to solve this question is to check for all integer starting from 1 to n and for each check whether integer minus digit sum is greater than s or not. This will become very time costly because we have to traverse 1 to n and for each integer we also have to calculate the digit sum.
Before moving to better approach lets have some key analysis about this questions and its features: 
 

For the largest possible integer (say long long int i.e. 10^18), the maximum possible digit sum is 9*18 (when all of digits are nine) = 162. This means in any case all the integer greater than s + 162 satisfy the condition of integer – digitSum > s.
All integer less than s can not satisfy the given condition for sure.
All the integers within a tens range (0-9, 10-19…100-109) does have same value of integer minus digitSum.
Using above three key features we can shorten our approach and time complexity in a manner where we have to iterate only over s to s+163 integers. Beside checking for all integer within range we only check for each 10th integer (e.g 150, 160, 170..). 
Algorithm: 
 

// if n < s then return 0
if n<s 
    return 0
else

    // iterate for s to min(n, s+163)
    for i=s to i min(n, s+163)

        // return n-i+1
        if (i-digitSum)>s
            return (n-i+1)

// if no such integer found return 0
return 0

    while (n>0):
        digSum += n % 10
        n //= 10
   
    return digSum
  
# function to calculate

def countInteger(n, s):
     
    # if n < s no integer possible
    if (n < s):
        return 0
  
    # iterate for s range
    # and then calculate
    # total count of such
    # integer if starting
    # integer is found
    for i in range(s,min(n, s + 163)+1):
        if ((i - digitSum(i)) > s):
            return (n - i + 1)
  
    # if no integer found return 0
    return 0
