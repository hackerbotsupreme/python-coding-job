Given three numbers a, b and k, find k-th digit in ab from right side
Examples: 

Input : a = 3, b = 3, k = 1
Output : 7
Explanation: 3^3 = 27 for k = 1. First digit is 7 in 27

Input : a = 5, b = 2,  k = 2
Output : 2

Explanation: 5^2 = 25 for k = 2. First digit is 2 in 25

# Python3 code to compute k-th
# digit in a^b
def kthdigit(a, b, k):
     
    # computing a^b in python
    p = a ** b
    count = 0
     
    while (p > 0 and count < k):
         
        # getting last digit
        rem = p % 10
 
        # increasing count by 1
        count = count + 1
 
        # if current number is
        # required digit
        if (count == k):
            return rem
 
        # remove last digit
        p = p / 10;

a = 5
b = 2
k = 1

How to avoid overflow? 
We can find power under modulo 10sup>k to avoid overflow. After finding the power under modulo, we need to return first digit of the power.
