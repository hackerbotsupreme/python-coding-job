Given a number and no. of digits to represent the number, find if the given number can be represented in given no. of digits in any base from 2 to 32.
Examples : 
 

Input: 8 4  
Output: Yes
Possible in base 2 as 8 in base 2 is 1000

Input: 8 2 
Output: Yes 
Possible in base 3 as 8 in base 3 is 22

Input: 8 3  
Output: No
Not possible in any base

The idea is to check all bases one by one starting from base 2 to base 32. How do we check for a given base? Following are simple steps. 
1) IF the number is smaller than the base and the digit is 1, then return true. 
2) Else if the digit is more than 1 and the number is more than base, then remove the last digit from num by doing num/base, reduce the number of digits and recur. 
3) Else return false
Below is the implementation of the above idea. 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python program to check
# if a given number can be
# represented in given number
# of digits in any base
 
# Returns true if 'num' can
# be represented using 'dig'
# digits in 'base'
def checkUtil(num,dig,base):
     
    # Base case
    if (dig==1 and num < base):
        return True
  
    # If there are more than 1
    # digits left and number
    # is more than base, then
    # remove last digit by doing
    # num/base, reduce the number
    # of digits and recur
    if (dig > 1 and num >= base):
        return checkUtil(num/base, --dig, base)
  
    return False
  
# return true of num can
# be represented in 'dig'
# digits in any base from 2 to 32
def check(num,dig):
 
    # Check for all bases one by one
    for base in range(2,33):
 
        if (checkUtil(num, dig, base)):
            return True
    return False
 
# driver code
num = 8
dig = 3
if(check(num, dig)==True):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
