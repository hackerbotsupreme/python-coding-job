Write a program to check if a given integer is jumbled or not. A number is said to be Jumbled if for every digit, its neighbours digit differs by max 1. 

Examples : 

Input : 6765
Output : True
All neighbour digits differ by atmost 1.

Input : 1223
Output : True

Input : 1235
Output : False

 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach:

Find the adjacent digits in the number while num > 0
if the absolute difference of the digits is greater than 1.
Return false
Return True
Below is the implementation of the above idea : 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python code to check if
# a number is jumbled or not
 
# Function to check if a
# number is jumbled or not
def checkJumbled(num):
 
    # Single digit number
    if (num // 10 == 0):
        return True
 
    # Checking every digit
    # through a loop
    while (num != 0):
         
        # All digits were checked
        if (num // 10 == 0):
            return True
 
        # Digit at index i
        digit1 = num % 10
 
        # Digit at index i-1
        digit2 = (num // 10) % 10
 
        # If difference is
        # greater than 1
        if (abs(digit2 - digit1) > 1):
            return False
 
        num = num // 10
         
    # Number checked
    return True
     
# Driver code
 
# -1234 to be checked
num = -1234
if (checkJumbled(abs(num))):
    print (True)
else:
    print (False)
     
# -1247 to be checked
num = -1247
if (checkJumbled(abs(num))):
    print (True)
else:
    print (False)
