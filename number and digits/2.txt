Given a positive integer n, print first k digits after point in value of 1/n. Your program should avoid overflow and floating point arithmetic.
Examples : 
 

Input:   n = 3, k = 3
Output:  333

Input:   n = 50, k = 4
Output:  0200

Let us consider an example n = 7, k = 3. The first digit of 1/7 is ‘1’, it can be obtained by doing integer value of 10/7. Remainder of 10/7 is 3. Next digit is 4 which can be obtained by taking integer value of 30/7. Remainder of 30/7 is 2. Next digits is 2 which can be obtained by taking integer value of 20/7

# Python code to Print first k
# digits of 1/n where n is a
# positive integer
import math
 
# Function to print first k digits
# after dot in value of 1/n. n is
# assumed to be a positive integer.
def Print(n, k):
    rem = 1 # Initialize remainder
     
    # Run a loop k times to print
    # k digits
    for i in range(0, k):
        # The next digit can always
        # be obtained as doing
        # (10*rem)/10
        print(math.floor(((10 * rem)
                       / n)), end="")
         
        # Update remainder
        rem = (10*rem) % n
 
# Driver program to test
# above function
n = 7
k = 3
Print(n, k);
print(" ")
n = 21
k = 4
Print(n, k);
