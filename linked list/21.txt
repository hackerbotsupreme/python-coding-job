Given a circular linked list, count the number of nodes in it. For example, the output is 5 for the below list. 



Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: We use the concept used in Circular Linked List | Set 2 (Traversal). While traversing, we keep track of the count of nodes. 

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to count number of nodes in
# a circular linked list.
  
# structure for a node
class Node: 
    def __init__(self, data): 
        self.data = data 
        self.next = None
  
# Function to insert a node at the beginning
# of a Circular linked list */
def push(head_ref,data):
  
    ptr1 = Node(0)
    temp = head_ref
    ptr1.data = data
    ptr1.next = head_ref
  
    # If the linked list is not None then set
    # the next of last node 
    if (head_ref != None) :
        while (temp.next != head_ref):
            temp = temp.next
        temp.next = ptr1
    else:
        ptr1.next = ptr1 #For the first node */
  
    head_ref = ptr1
    return head_ref
  
# Function to print nodes 
# in a given Circular linked list 
def countNodes(head):
  
    temp = head
    result = 0
    if (head != None) :
        while True :
            temp = temp.next
            result = result + 1
            if (temp == head):
                break
      
    return result
  
# Driver Code 
if __name__=='__main__': 
  
    # Initialize lists as empty */
    head = None
    head = push(head, 12)
    head = push(head, 56)
    head = push(head, 2)
    head = push(head, 11)
  
    print( countNodes(head))

Output
4
Time Complexity: O(n), As we are visiting every node just once.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used
