Given a singly linked list, we have to convert it into circular linked list. For example, we have been given a singly linked list with four nodes and we want to convert this singly linked list into circular linked list.
 

Singly-Linked-List

The above singly linked list is converted into circular linked list. 
 

Circular-Linked-List


Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: The idea is to traverse the singly linked list and check if the node is the last node or not. If the node is the last node i.e pointing to NULL then make it point to the starting node i.e head node. Below is the implementation of this approach.

Implementation:

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python3 program for converting
# singly linked list into
# circular linked list.
import sys
 
# Linked list node
class Node:
    def __init__(self,data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
 
def push(head, data):
    if not head:
        return Node(data)
 
    # Allocate dynamic memory
    # for newNode.
    # Assign the data into newNode.
    newNode = Node(data)
 
    # newNode.next assign the
    # address of head node.
    newNode.next = head
 
    # newNode become the headNode.
    head = newNode
    return head
 
# Function that convert
# singly linked list into
# circular linked list.
def circular(head):
 
    # declare a node variable
    # start and assign head
    # node into start node.
    start = head
 
    # check that while head.next
    # not equal to null then head
    # points to next node.
    while(head.next is not None):
        head = head.next
 
    # if head.next points to null
    # then start assign to the
    # head.next node.    
    head.next = start
    return start
 
# Function that display the elements
# of circular linked list.
def displayList(node):
    start = node
    while(node.next is not start):
        print("{} ".format(node.data),end="")
        node=node.next
 
    # Display the last node of
    # circular linked list.
    print("{} ".format(node.data),end="")
 
# Driver Code
if __name__=='__main__':
     
    # Start with empty list
    head=None
 
    # Using push() function to
    # convert singly linked list
    # 17.22.13.14.15
    head=push(head,15)
    head=push(head,14)
    head=push(head,13)
    head=push(head,22)
    head=push(head,17)
 
    # Call the circular_list function
    # that convert singly linked
    # list to circular linked list.
    circular(head)
    print("Display List:")
    displayList(head)

Time Complexity: O(n), As we need to move through the whole list to get hold of the last node.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), As constant extra space is used.
