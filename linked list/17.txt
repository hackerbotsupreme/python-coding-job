Given a Linked List and a number N, write a function that returns the value at the Nth node from the end of the Linked List.


Linked-List

Examples:

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, N = 3
Output: 2

Input: 35 -> 15 -> 4 -> 20, N = 4
Output: 35

Naive Approach: Follow the given steps to solve the problem using this approach: 

Calculate the length of the Linked List. Let the length be len. 
Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the beginning of the Linked List. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C
C++14
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find
# N'th node from end
  
class Node:
    def __init__(self, new_data):
        self.data = new_data
        self.next = None
  
  
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
  
    # CreateNode and make linked list
    def push(self, new_data):
        new_node = Node(new_data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
  
    # Function to get the nth node from
    # the last of a linked list
    def printNthFromLast(self, n):
        temp = self.head  # Used temp variable
  
        length = 0
        while temp is not None:
            temp = temp.next
            length += 1
  
        # Print count
        if n > length:  # If entered location is greater
                       # than length of linked list
            print('Location is greater than the' +
                  ' length of LinkedList')
            return
        temp = self.head
        for i in range(0, length - n):
            temp = temp.next
        print(temp.data)
  
  
# Driver's Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    llist = LinkedList()
    llist.push(20)
    llist.push(4)
    llist.push(15)
    llist.push(35)
  
    # Function call
    llist.printNthFromLast(4)

Output


35
Time complexity: O(M) where M is the size of the linked list
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Below is a recursive code for the same method. Thanks to Anuj Bansal for providing the following code.

C
C++
Java
Python3
def printNthFromLast(head, N):
      
    i = 0
    if (head == None)
        return
    printNthFromLast(head.next, N);
    i += 1
    if (i == N):
        print(head.data)

Nth node from the end of a Linked List using two pointers:
As Nth node from the end equals to (Length – N + 1)th node from the start, so the idea is to Maintain two pointers starting from the head of the Linked-List and move one pointer to the Nth node from the start and then move both the pointers together until the pointer at the Nth position reaches the last node. Now the pointer which was moved later points at the Nth node from the end of the Linked-List

Below image is a dry run of the above approach:



Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

Maintain two pointers main_ptr and ref_ptr
Move ref_ptr to the Nth node from the start
Now move both main_ptr and ref_ptr, until the ref_ptr reaches the last node
Now print the data of the main_ptr, as it is at the Nth node from the end
Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find N'th node from end
  
# Node class
  
  
class Node:
  
    # Constructor to initialize the node object
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
  
  
class LinkedList:
  
    # Function to initialize head
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
  
    # Function to insert a new node at the beginning
    def push(self, new_data):
        new_node = Node(new_data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
  
    def printNthFromLast(self, N):
        main_ptr = self.head
        ref_ptr = self.head
  
        count = 0
        if(self.head is not None):
            while(count < N):
                if(ref_ptr is None):
                    print("% d is greater than the no. pf nodes in list" % (N))
                    return
                ref_ptr = ref_ptr.next
                count += 1
  
        if(ref_ptr is None):
            self.head = self.head.next
            if(self.head is not None):
                print("Node no. % d from last is % d "
                      % (N, main_ptr.data))
        else:
  
            while(ref_ptr is not None):
                main_ptr = main_ptr.next
                ref_ptr = ref_ptr.next
  
            print("Node no. % d from last is % d "
                  % (N, main_ptr.data))
  
  
# Driver's code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    llist = LinkedList()
    llist.push(20)
    llist.push(4)
    llist.push(15)
    llist.push(35)
  
    # Function call
    llist.printNthFromLast(4)

Output
35->15->4->20->NULL
Node no. 4 from end is: 35
Time Complexity: O(M) where M is the length of the linked list.
