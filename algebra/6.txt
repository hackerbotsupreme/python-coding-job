There are two vector A and B and we have to find the dot product and cross product of two vector array. Dot product is also known as scalar product and cross product also known as vector product.
Dot Product – Let we have given two vector A = a1 * i + a2 * j + a3 * k and B = b1 * i + b2 * j + b3 * k. Where i, j and k are the unit vector along the x, y and z directions. Then dot product is calculated as dot product = a1 * b1 + a2 * b2 + a3 * b3
Example – 
 

A = 3 * i + 5 * j + 4 * k
B = 2 * i + 7 * j + 5 * k
dot product = 3 * 2 + 5 * 7 + 4 * 5
            = 6 + 35 + 20
            = 61
Cross Product – Let we have given two vector A = a1 * i + a2 * j + a3 * k and B = b1 * i + b2 * j + b3 * k. Then cross product is calculated as cross product = (a2 * b3 – a3 * b2) * i + (a3 * b1 – a1 * b3) * j + (a1 * b2 – a2 * b1) * k, where [(a2 * b3 – a3 * b2), (a3 * b1 – a1 * b3), (a1 * b2 – a2 * b1)] are the coefficient of unit vector along i, j and k directions.
Example – 
 

A = 3 * i + 5 * j + 4 * k
B = 2 * i + 7 * j + 5 * k
cross product 
= (5 * 5 - 4 * 7) * i 
      + (4 * 2 - 3 * 5) * j + (3 * 7 - 5 * 2) * k
= (-3)*i + (-7)*j + (11)*k
Example – 
 

Input: vect_A[] = {3, -5, 4}
        vect_B[] = {2, 6, 5}
Output: Dot product: -4
         Cross product = -49 -7 28
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Code- 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 implementation for dot product
# and cross product of two vector.
 
n = 3
 
# Function that return
# dot product of two vector array.
def dotProduct(vect_A, vect_B):
 
    product = 0
 
    # Loop for calculate dot product
    for i in range(0, n):
        product = product + vect_A[i] * vect_B[i]
 
    return product
 
# Function to find
# cross product of two vector array.
def crossProduct(vect_A, vect_B, cross_P):
 
    cross_P.append(vect_A[1] * vect_B[2] - vect_A[2] * vect_B[1])
    cross_P.append(vect_A[2] * vect_B[0] - vect_A[0] * vect_B[2])
    cross_P.append(vect_A[0] * vect_B[1] - vect_A[1] * vect_B[0])
 
 
# Driver function
if __name__=='__main__':
    vect_A = [3, -5, 4]
    vect_B = [2, 6, 5]
    cross_P = []
 
# dotProduct function call
    print("Dot product:", end =" ")
    print(dotProduct(vect_A, vect_B))
 
# crossProduct function call
    print("Cross product:", end =" ")
    crossProduct(vect_A, vect_B, cross_P)
 
# Loop that print
# cross product of two vector array.
    for i in range(0, n):
        print(cross_P[i], end =" ")

Javascript
Output: 
Dot product:-4
Cross product:-49 -7 28
 

Time Complexity: O(3), the code will run in a constant time because the size of the arrays will be always 3.
Auxiliary Space: O(3), no extra space is required, so it is a constant.
