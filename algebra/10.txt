Given a number n, find the number of ways in which  we can add 3 non-negative integers so that their sum is n.
Examples : 
 

Input : n = 1
Output : 3
There are three ways to get sum 1.
(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1)

Input : n = 2
Output : 6
There are six ways to get sum 2.
(2, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 2), (1, 1, 0)
(1, 0, 1) and (0, 1, 1)

Input : n = 3
Output : 10
There are ten ways to get sum 3.
(3, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 0, 3), (1, 2, 0)
(1, 0, 2), (0, 1, 2), (2, 1, 0), (2, 0, 1),
(0, 2, 1) and (1, 1, 1)

Method 1 [ Brute Force : O(n3) ] 
A simple solution is to consider all triplets using three loops. For every triplet, check if its sum is equal to n. If the sum is n, increment the count of solutions. 
Below is the implementation. 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to count
# solutions of a + b + c = n
 
# Returns count of solutions
# of a + b + c = n
def countIntegralSolutions (n):
 
    # Initialize result
    result = 0
     
    # Consider all triplets and
    # increment result whenever
    # sum of a triplet is n.
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(n + 1):
            for k in range(n + 1):
                if i + j + k == n:
                    result += 1
     
    return result
     
# Driver code
n = 3
print(countIntegralSolutions(n))

10
Time complexity: O(n3)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method 2 [ Direct Formula : O(1) ] 
If we take a closer look at the pattern, we can find that the count of solutions is ((n+1) * (n+2)) / 2. The problem is equivalent to distributing n identical balls  in three boxes and the solution is n+2C2. In general, if there are m variables (or boxes) and n balls , the formula becomes n+m-1Cm-1.
