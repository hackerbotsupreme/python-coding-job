Given two integer N ans K, the task is to find sum of modulo K of first N natural numbers i.e 1%K + 2%K + ….. + N%K.

Examples : 

Input : N = 10 and K = 2.
Output : 5
Sum = 1%2 + 2%2 + 3%2 + 4%2 + 5%2 + 6%2 +
      7%2 + 8%2 + 9%2 + 10%2
   = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0
   = 5.

Method 1: 

Iterate a variable i from 1 to N, evaluate and add i%K. 

Below is the implementation of this approach:  

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find sum
# of modulo K of first N
# natural numbers.
 
# Return sum of modulo K of
# first N natural numbers.
 
def findSum(N, K):
    ans = 0;
 
    # Iterate from 1 to N &&
    # evaluating and adding i % K.
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        ans += (i % K);
 
    return ans;
 
# Driver Code
N = 10;
K = 2;
print(findSum(N, K));

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method 2 : 
Two cases arise in this method.
Case 1: When N < K, for each number i, N >= i >= 1, will give i as result when operate with modulo K. So, the required sum will be the sum of the first N natural number, N*(N+1)/2.
Case 2: When N >= K, then integers from 1 to K in natural number sequence will produce, 1, 2, 3, ….., K – 1, 0 as result when operate with modulo K. Similarly, from K + 1 to 2K, it will produce same result. So, the idea is to count how many numbers of times this sequence appears and multiply it with the sum of first K – 1 natural numbers. 

Below is the implementation of this approach:  

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find sum of modulo
# K of first N natural numbers.
 
# Return sum of modulo K of
# first N natural numbers.
def findSum(N, K):
 
    ans = 0;
 
    # Counting the number of times
    # 1, 2, .., K-1, 0 sequence occurs.
    y = N / K;
 
    # Finding the number of elements
    # left which are incomplete of
    # sequence Leads to Case 1 type.
    x = N % K;
 
    # adding multiplication of number
    # of times 1, 2, .., K-1, 0
    # sequence occurs and sum of
    # first k natural number and
    # sequence from case 1.
    ans = ((K * (K - 1) / 2) * y +
                (x * (x + 1)) / 2);
 
    return int(ans);
 
# Driver Code
N = 10;
K = 2;
