Given two numbers base and exp, we need to compute baseexp under Modulo 10^9+7 Examples:

Input : base = 2, exp = 2
Output : 4

Input  : base = 5, exp = 100000
Output : 754573817
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
In competitions, for calculating large powers of a number we are given a modulus value(a large prime number) because as the values of x^y    is being calculated it can get very large so instead we have to calculate (x^y    %modulus value.) We can use the modulus in our naive way by using modulus on all the intermediate steps and take modulus at the end, but in competitions it will definitely show TLE. So, what we can do. The answer is we can try exponentiation by squaring which is a fast method for calculating exponentiation of a number. Here we will be discussing two most common/important methods:

Basic Method(Binary Exponentiation)
2^k    -ary method.
Binary Exponentiation

As described in this article we will be using following formula to recursively calculate (x^y    %modulus value): {\displaystyle x^{n}={\begin{cases}x\,(x^{2})^{\frac {n-1}{2}},&{\mbox{if }}n{\mbox{ is odd}}\\(x^{2})^{\frac {n}{2}},&{\mbox{if }}n{\mbox{ is even}}.\end{cases}}}

# modulo using binary
# exponentiation.
 
# prime modulo value
N = 1000000007;
     
# Function code
def exponentiation(bas, exp):
    if (exp == 0):
        return 1;
    if (exp == 1):
        return bas % N;
     
    t = exponentiation(bas, int(exp / 2));
    t = (t * t) % N;
     
    # if exponent is
    # even value
    if (exp % 2 == 0):
        return t;
         
    # if exponent is
    # odd value
    else:
        return ((bas % N) * t) % N;
 
# Driver code
bas = 5;
exp = 100000;
 
modulo = exponentiation(bas, exp);
print(modulo);

   -ary method:

In this algorithm we will be expanding the exponent in base 2^k    (k>=1), which is somehow similar to above method except we are not using recursion this method uses comparatively less memory and time.

        # for cases where exponent

Applications: Besides fast calculation of x^y    this method have several other advantages, like it is used in cryptography, in calculating Matrix Exponentiation et cetera.
