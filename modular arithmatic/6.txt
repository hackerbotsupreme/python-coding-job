Given a big number ‘num’ represented as string and an integer x, find value of “num % a” or “num mod a”. Output is expected as an integer.

Examples : 

Input:  num = "12316767678678",  a = 10
Output: num (mod a) ≡ 8
The idea is to process all digits one by one and use the property that 

xy (mod a) ≡ ((x (mod a) * 10) + (y (mod a))) mod a

where, x : left-most digit

y: rest of the digits except x.

for example: 

625 % 5 = (((6 % 5)*10) + (25 % 5)) % 5 = 0

Below is the implementation.

Thanks to utkarsh111 for suggesting the below solution.

C++
Java
Python3
# program to compute mod of a big number
# represented as string
 
# Function to compute num (mod a)
 
 
def mod(num, a):
 
    # Initialize result
    res = 0
 
    # One by one process all digits
    # of 'num'
    for i in range(0, len(num)):
        res = (res * 10 + int(num[i])) % a
 
    return res
 
 
# Driver program
num = "12316767678678"
print(mod(num, 10))

PHP
Javascript
Output : 

8
Time Complexity : O(|num|)

Time complexity will become size of num string as we are traversing once in num.
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
