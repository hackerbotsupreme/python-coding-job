a=3
b=4
print ("the value of a+b is",a+b,asdk)# i can print as many i can by putting commas
#but keep in mind the value mustt be defined#thats why you will see this line is giving error
print ( " the value of a+b is" , a+b)#and this line will be executed
#another thing to note that doble quotes are strings but rest arre expression thats why they 
#are getting executed where others are printed as it is.aloso in this case we are using 
#an arithmatic operator but there are more -,*,/,+ so there is a total 4 types of arithmatic operator
#+,-,*,/ like
print (a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)
