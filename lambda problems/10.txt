Given two arrays, find their intersection. Examples:

Input:  arr1[] = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
        arr2[] = [2, 3, 5, 6]
Output: Intersection : [3, 5]
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We have existing solution for this problem please refer Intersection of two arrays link. We will solve this problem quickly in python using Lambda expression and filter() function. 

Implementation:


# Function to find intersection of two arrays
 
def interSection(arr1,arr2):
 
    # filter(lambda x: x in arr1, arr2) -->
    # filter element x from list arr2 where x
    # also lies in arr1
    result = list(filter(lambda x: x in arr1, arr2))
    print ("Intersection : ",result)
 
# Driver program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr1 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
    arr2 = [2, 3, 5, 6]
    interSection(arr1,arr2)
Output:


Intersection : [3, 5]
