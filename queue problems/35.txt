Given a square chessboard of N x N size, the position of the Knight and the position of a target are given. We need to find out the minimum steps a Knight will take to reach the target position.

Examples: 

Input: 
 


 

Output: 3
Explanation: In above diagram Knight takes 3 step to reach 
                      from (4, 5) to (1, 1) 
                     (4, 5) -> (5, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (1, 1)

Steps by Knight
Try It!
Minimum steps to reach the target by a Knight using BFS:
To solve the problem follow the below idea:

This problem can be seen as the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Therefore we use BFS to solve this problem. 

We try all 8 possible positions where a Knight can reach from its position. If the reachable position is not already visited and is inside the board, we push this state into the queue with a distance 1 more than its parent state. Finally, we return the distance of the target position, when it gets pop out from the queue

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find minimum steps to reach
# to specific cell in minimum moves by Knight
 
 
class cell:
 
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, dist=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.dist = dist
 
# checks whether given position is
# inside the board
 
 
def isInside(x, y, N):
    if (x >= 1 and x <= N and
            y >= 1 and y <= N):
        return True
    return False
 
# Method returns minimum step to reach
# target position
 
 
def minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                         targetpos, N):
 
    # all possible movements for the knight
    dx = [2, 2, -2, -2, 1, 1, -1, -1]
    dy = [1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2]
 
    queue = []
 
    # push starting position of knight
    # with 0 distance
    queue.append(cell(knightpos[0], knightpos[1], 0))
 
    # make all cell unvisited
    visited = [[False for i in range(N + 1)]
               for j in range(N + 1)]
 
    # visit starting state
    visited[knightpos[0]][knightpos[1]] = True
 
    # loop until we have one element in queue
    while(len(queue) > 0):
 
        t = queue[0]
        queue.pop(0)
 
        # if current cell is equal to target
        # cell, return its distance
        if(t.x == targetpos[0] and
           t.y == targetpos[1]):
            return t.dist
 
        # iterate for all reachable states
        for i in range(8):
 
            x = t.x + dx[i]
            y = t.y + dy[i]
 
            if(isInside(x, y, N) and not visited[x][y]):
                visited[x][y] = True
                queue.append(cell(x, y, t.dist + 1))
 
 
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = 30
    knightpos = [1, 1]
    targetpos = [30, 30]
 
    # Function call
    print(minStepToReachTarget(knightpos,
                               targetpos, N))

Time complexity: O(N2). In the worst case, all the cells will be visited
Auxiliary Space: O(N2). The nodes are stored in a queue.
