Given a number N, write a function that generates and prints all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to N. 

Examples: 

Input: n = 2
Output: 1, 10

Input: n = 5
Output: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101

Naive Method: To solve the problem follow the below idea:

A simple method is to run a loop from 1 to n, and call decimal to binary inside the loop. 

Generate Binary Numbers from 1 to n using the queue:
Follow the given steps to solve the problem:



Create an empty queue of strings 
Enqueue the first binary number “1” to the queue. 
Now run a loop for generating and printing n binary numbers. 
Dequeue and Print the front of queue. 
Append “0” at the end of front item and enqueue it. 
Append “1” at the end of front item and enqueue it.
Thanks to Vivek for suggesting this approach. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to generate binary numbers from
# 1 to n
 
# This function uses queue data structure to print binary numbers
 
 
def generatePrintBinary(n):
 
    # Create an empty queue
    from queue import Queue
    q = Queue()
 
    # Enqueue the first binary number
    q.put("1")
 
    # This loop is like BFS of a tree with 1 as root
    # 0 as left child and 1 as right child and so on
    while(n > 0):
        n -= 1
        # Print the front of queue
        s1 = q.get()
        print(s1)
 
        s2 = s1  # Store s1 before changing it
 
        # Append "0" to s1 and enqueue it
        q.put(s1+"0")
 
        # Append "1" to s2 and enqueue it. Note that s2
        # contains the previous front
        q.put(s2+"1")
 
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 10
 
    # Function call
    generatePrintBinary(n)

Javascript
Output
1
10
11
100
101
110
111
1000
1001
1010
Time Complexity: O(N) 
Auxiliary Space: O(N) as extra space is required in this method
