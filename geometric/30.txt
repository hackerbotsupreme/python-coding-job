Given two sides A, B and angle C. Find the third side of the triangle using law of cosines.
Examples: 
 

Input : a = 5, b = 8, c = 49 
Output : 6.04339 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
In particular, the Law of Cosines can be used to find the length of the third side of a triangle when you know the length of two sides and the angle in between. See here to learn to how to find the value of cos. 
Let us assume a, b, c are the sides of triangle where c is the side across from angle C. Then, 
 

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b*cos(c) 
OR
c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b*cos(c))

# Python3 program to find third side
# of triangle using law of cosines
import math as mt
 
# Function to calculate cos
# value of angle c
def cal_cos(n):
 
    accuracy = 0.0001
    x1, denominator, cosx, cosval = 0, 0, 0, 0
 
    # Converting degrees to radian
    n = n * (3.142 / 180.0)
 
    x1 = 1
 
    # Maps the sum along the series
    cosx = x1
 
    # Holds the actual value of sin(n)
    cosval = mt.cos(n)
    i = 1
    while (accuracy <= abs(cosval - cosx)):
 
        denominator = 2 * i * (2 * i - 1)
        x1 = -x1 * n * n / denominator
        cosx = cosx + x1
        i = i + 1
 
    return cosx
 
# Function to find third side
def third_side(a, b, c):
    angle = cal_cos(c)
    return mt.sqrt((a * a) +
                   (b * b) - 2 * a * b * angle)
 
# Driver Code
c = 49
a, b = 5, 8
print(third_side(a, b, c))

Output


6.04339
Time Complexity: O(log(n)), since using inbuilt sqrt function
Auxiliary Space: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.
