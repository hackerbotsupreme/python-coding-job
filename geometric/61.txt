Given four points, check whether they form Pythagorean Quadruple. 
It is defined as a tuple of integers a, b, c, d such that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2   . They are basically the solutions of Diophantine Equations. In the geometric interpretation it represents a cuboid with integer side lengths |a|, |b|, |c| and whose space diagonal is |d| . 
 



The cuboids sides shown here are examples of pythagorean quadruples. 
It is primitive when their greatest common divisor is 1. Every Pythagorean quadruple is an integer multiple of a primitive quadruple. We can generate the set of primitive pythagorean quadruples for which a is odd can be generated by formula :
 

a = m2 + n2 – p2 – q2, 
b = 2(mq + np), 
c = 2(nq – mp), 
d = m2 + n2 + p2 + q2

where m, n, p, q are non-negative integers with greatest common divisor 1 such that m + n + p + q are odd. Thus, all primitive Pythagorean quadruples are characterized by Lebesgue’s identity.
 

(m2 + n2 + p2 + q2)2 = (2mq + 2nq)2 + 2(nq – mp)2 + (m2 + n2 – p2 – q2)m2 + n2 – p2 – q2
