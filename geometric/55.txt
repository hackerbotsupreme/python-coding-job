Ellipsoid, closed surface of which all plane cross sections are either ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid is symmetrical about three mutually perpendicular axes that intersect at the center. It is a three-dimensional, closed geometric shape, all planar sections of which are ellipses or circles. 
An ellipsoid has three independent axes, and is usually specified by the lengths a, b, c of the three semi-axes. If an ellipsoid is made by rotating an ellipse about one of its axes, then two axes of the ellipsoid are the same, and it is called an ellipsoid of revolution, or spheroid. If the lengths of all three of its axes are the same, it is a sphere. 
 

Standard equation of Ellipsoid :
x2 / a2 + y2 / b2 + z2 / c2 = 1
   
where a, b, c are positive real numbers.
Volume of Ellipsoid :  (4/3) * pi * r1 * r2 * r3 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Below is code for calculating volume of ellipsoid :
 

C++
Java
Python
''' Python3 program to Volume of ellipsoid'''
import math
 
# Function To calculate Volume
def volumeOfEllipsoid(r1, r2, r3):
    return 1.33 * math.pi * r1 * r2 * r3
 
 
# Driver Code
r1 = float(2.3)
r2 = float(3.4)
r3 = float(5.7)
print( "Volume of ellipsoid is : ",
        volumeOfEllipsoid(r1, r2, r3) )
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output : 
 

Volume of ellipsoid is : 186.15
Time Complexity: O(1) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Please suggest if someone has a better solution which is more efficient in terms of space and time.
