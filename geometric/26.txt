Given coordinates of all three vertices of the triangle in the 2D plane, the task is to find all three angles.
Example: 
 

Input : A = (0, 0), 
        B = (0, 1), 
        C = (1, 0)
Output : 90, 45, 45
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
To solve this problem we use below Law of cosines. 
 

all angles of a given triangle

 

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2(a)(b)(cos beta)
After re-arranging 
 

beta = acos( ( a^2 + b^2 - c^2 ) / (2ab) )
In trigonometry, the law of cosines (also known as the cosine formula or cosine rule) relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles.
 



First, calculate the length of all the sides. 
Then apply above formula to get all angles in 
radian. Then convert angles from radian into 
degrees.
Below is implementation of above steps.

Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find all three angles
# of a triangle given coordinate
# of all three vertices
import math
 
# returns square of distance b/w two points
def lengthSquare(X, Y):
    xDiff = X[0] - Y[0]
    yDiff = X[1] - Y[1]
    return xDiff * xDiff + yDiff * yDiff
     
def printAngle(A, B, C):
     
    # Square of lengths be a2, b2, c2
    a2 = lengthSquare(B, C)
    b2 = lengthSquare(A, C)
    c2 = lengthSquare(A, B)
 
    # length of sides be a, b, c
    a = math.sqrt(a2);
    b = math.sqrt(b2);
    c = math.sqrt(c2);
 
    # From Cosine law
    alpha = math.acos((b2 + c2 - a2) /
                         (2 * b * c));
    betta = math.acos((a2 + c2 - b2) /
                         (2 * a * c));
    gamma = math.acos((a2 + b2 - c2) /
                         (2 * a * b));
 
    # Converting to degree
    alpha = alpha * 180 / math.pi;
    betta = betta * 180 / math.pi;
    gamma = gamma * 180 / math.pi;
 
    # printing all the angles
    print("alpha : %f" %(alpha))
    print("betta : %f" %(betta))
    print("gamma : %f" %(gamma))
         
# Driver code
A = (0, 0)
B = (0, 1)
C = (1, 0)
 
printAngle(A, B, C);

Output: 
 

alpha : 90
beta : 45
gamma : 45
Time Complexity: O(log(n)) since using inbuilt sqrt functions

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
