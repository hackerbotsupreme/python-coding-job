Given three non-collinear integral points in XY plane, find the number of integral points inside the triangle formed by the three points. (A point in XY plane is said to be integral/lattice point if both its co-ordinates are integral).

Example: 

Input: p = (0, 0), q = (0, 5) and r = (5,0) 
Output: 6
Explanation: The points (1,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,1) (2,2) and (3,1) are the integral points inside the triangle.

We can use the Pickâ€™s theorem, which states that the following equation holds true for a simple Polygon. 

Pick's Theorem:
 A = I + (B/2) -1

A ==> Area of Polygon
B ==> Number of integral points on edges of polygon
I ==> Number of integral points inside the polygon

Using the above formula, we can deduce,
I = (2A - B + 2) / 2 
We can find A (area of triangle) using below Shoelace formula. 



A =  1/2 * abs(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) 
How to find B (number of integral points on edges of a triangle)? 
We can find the number of integral points between any two vertex (V1, V2) of the triangle using the following algorithm. 

1. If the edge formed by joining V1 and V2 is parallel 
   to the X-axis, then the number of integral points 
   between the vertices is : 
        abs(V1.x - V2.x) - 1

2. Similarly, if edge is parallel to the Y-axis, then 
   the number of integral points in between is :
    abs(V1.y - V2.y) - 1

3. Else, we can find the integral points between the
   vertices using below formula:
     GCD(abs(V1.x-V2.x), abs(V1.y-V2.y)) - 1
   The above formula is a well known fact and can be 
   verified using simple geometry. (Hint: Shift the 
   edge such that one of the vertex lies at the Origin.)

Output: 

Number of integral points inside given triangle is 6
Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b))), as we are using recursion to find the GCD.
Auxiliary Space: O(log(min(a,b))), for recursive stack space.
