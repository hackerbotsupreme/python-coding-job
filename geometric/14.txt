Given two points P and Q in the coordinate plane, find the equation of the line passing through both points.
This kind of conversion is very useful in many geometric algorithms like intersection of lines, finding the circumcenter of a triangle, finding the incenter of a triangle and many moreâ€¦

Examples: 

Input : P(3, 2)
        Q(2, 6)
Output : 4x + 1y = 14

Input : P(0, 1)
        Q(2, 4)
Output : 3x + -2y = -2

Let the given two points be P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2). Now, we find the equation of line formed by these points.
Any line can be represented as, 
ax + by = c 
Let the two points satisfy the given line. So, we have, 
ax1 + by1 = c 
ax2 + by2 = c 

We can set the following values so that all the equations hold true,  

a = y2 - y1
b = x1 - x2
c = ax1 + by1
These can be derived by first getting the slope directly and then finding the intercept of the line. OR these can also be derived cleverly by a simple observation as under:

Derivation : 

ax1 + by1 = c ...(i)
ax2 + by2 = c ...(ii)
Equating (i) and (ii),
ax1 + by1 = ax2 + by2
=> a(x1 - x2) = b(y2 - y1)
Thus, for equating LHS and RHS, we can simply have,
a = (y2 - y1)
AND
b = (x1 - x2)
so that we have,
(y2 - y1)(x1 - x2) = (x1 - x2)(y2 - y1)
AND
Putting these values in (i), we get,
c = ax1 + by1 
Thus, we now have the values of a, b, and c which means that we have the line in the coordinate plane.

Output
The line passing through points P and Q is: 4x + 1y = 14
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1), since no extra space has been taken.
