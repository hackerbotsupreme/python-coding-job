Given a positive integer K, a circle center at (0, 0) and coordinates of some points. The task is to find minimum radius of the circle so that at-least k points lie inside the circle. Output the square of the minimum radius.
 

Examples:  

Input : (1, 1), (-1, -1), (1, -1), 
         k = 3
Output : 2
We need a circle of radius at least 2
to include 3 points.


Input : (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, -1), 
         k = 2
Output : 1
We need a circle of radius at least 1
to include 2 points. The circle around
(0, 0) of radius 1 would include (1, 1)
and (0, 1).
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to find square of Euclidean Distance of each point from origin (0, 0). Now, sort these distance in increasing order. Now the kth element of distance is the required minimum radius.
Below is the implementation of this approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find minimum radius
# such that atleast k point lie inside
# the circle
 
 
# Return minimum distance required so
# that atleast k point lie inside the
# circle.
def minRadius(k, x, y, n):
    dis = [0] * n
 
    # Finding distance between of each
    # point from origin
 
    for i in range(0, n):
        dis[i] = x[i] * x[i] + y[i] * y[i]
 
    # Sorting the distance
    dis.sort()
 
    return dis[k - 1]
         
# Driver Program
k = 3
x = [1, -1, 1]
y = [1, -1, -1]
n = len(x)
 
print(minRadius(k, x, y, n))
