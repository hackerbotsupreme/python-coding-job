Given coordinate of the center and radius > 1 of a circle and the equation of a line. The task is to check if the given line collides with the circle or not. There are three possibilities : 

Line intersects the circle.
Line touches the circle.
Line is outside the circle
 
Check if a line touches or intersects a circle

Note: General equation of a line is a*x + b*y + c = 0, so only constant a, b, c are given in the input.

Examples : 

Input : radius = 5, center = (0, 0), 
        a = 1, b = -1, c = 0.
Output : Intersect

Input :  radius = 5, center = (0, 0), 
         a = 5, b = 0, c = 0.
Output : Touch

Input : radius = 5, center = (0, 0),
         a = 1, b = 1, c = -16.
Output : Outside
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to compare the perpendicular distance between center of circle and line with the radius of the circle.
Algorithm: 
1. Find the perpendicular (say p) between center of circle and given line. 
2. Compare this distance p with radius r. 
……a) If p > r, then line lie outside the circle. 
……b) If p = r, then line touches the circle. 
……c) If p < r, then line intersect the circle.
How to find the perpendicular distance? 
Distance of a line from a point can be computed using below formula:
\frac{ax_{0}+by_{0}+c}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}      
Refer Wiki for details of above formula. 

C++
Java
Python3
# python program to check if a line
# touches or  intersects or outside
# a circle.
 
import math
 
def checkCollision(a, b, c, x, y, radius):
     
    # Finding the distance of line
    # from center.
    dist = ((abs(a * x + b * y + c)) /
            math.sqrt(a * a + b * b))
 
    # Checking if the distance is less
    # than, greater than or equal to radius.
    if (radius == dist):
        print("Touch")
    elif (radius > dist):
        print("Intersect")
    else:
        print("Outside")
 
# Driven Program
radius = 5
x = 0
y = 0
a = 3
b = 4
c = 25
checkCollision(a, b, c, x, y, radius)
