Given area and hypotenuse, the aim is to print all sides if right triangle can exist, else print -1. We need to print all sides in ascending order.

Examples: 

Input  : 6 5
Output : 3 4 5

Input  : 10 6
Output : -1 
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We have discussed a solution of this problem in below post. 
Find all sides of a right angled triangle from given hypotenuse and area | Set 1
In this post, a new solution with below logic is discussed.
Let the two unknown sides be a and b 
Area : A = 0.5 * a * b 
Hypotenuse Square : H^2 = a^2 + b^2 
Substituting b, we get H2 = a2 + (4 * A2)/a2 
On re-arranging, we get the equation a4 – (H2)(a2) + 4*(A2)
The discriminant D of this equation would be D = H4 – 16*(A2) 
If D = 0, then roots are given by the linear equation formula, roots = (-b +- sqrt(D) )/2*a 
these roots would be equal to the square of the sides, finding the square roots would give us the sides.

# Python program to check existence of
# right triangle.
from math import sqrt
 
# Prints three sides of a right triangle
# from given area and hypotenuse if triangle
# is possible, else prints -1.
def findRightAngle(A, H):
 
    # Descriminant of the equation
    D = pow(H,4) - 16 * A * A
    if D >= 0:
 
        # applying the linear equation
        # formula to find both the roots
        root1 = (H * H + sqrt(D))//2
        root2 = (H * H - sqrt(D))//2
 
        a = int(sqrt(root1))
        b = int(sqrt(root2))
        if b >= a:
            print (a, b, H)
        else:
            print (b, a, H)
    else:
        print ("-1")

# Area is 6 and hypotenuse is 5.
