A trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides, other two sides may not be parallel. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezium and the other two sides are called itâ€™s legs. The perpendicular distance between parallel sides is called height of trapezium.
 



Formula : 
 

Area of Trapezium : 0.5 * (a + b) * h
Perimeter of Trapezium : a + b + c + d
Examples : 
 

Input :  a = 5, b = 6, c = 4, d = 3, h = 8
Output : Area of Trapezium : 44
         Perimeter of Trapezium : 18

Input :  a = 10, b = 15, c = 14, d = 11, h = 21
Output : Area of Trapezium: 262.5
         Perimeter of Trapezium: 50
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Below is the implementation of above formula : 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find area
# and perimeter of trapezium
 
# Function to calculate
# Area of trapezium
def areaTrapezium (a, b, h):
    return (1.0 / 2 * (a + b) * h)
 
# Function to calculate
# perimeter of trapezium
def perimeterTrapezium (a, b, c, d):
    return (a + b + c + d)
 
# Driver function
a = 5
b = 15
c = 11
d = 4
h = 20
print("Area of Trapezium =",
      areaTrapezium(a, b, h))
 
print("Perimeter of Trapezium =",
      perimeterTrapezium(a, b, c, d))

Output: 



Area of Trapezium = 200
Perimeter of Trapezium = 35
Time complexity: O(1)

space complexity: O(1)
