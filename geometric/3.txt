In this article, we will learn how to print the pattern G using stars and white-spaces. Given a number n, we will write a program to print the pattern G over n lines or rows.
Examples: 
 

Input : 7
Output :
  ***  
 *     
 *     
 * *** 
 *   * 
 *   * 
  ***  

Input : 9
Output :
  *****  
 *       
 *       
 *       
 *   *** 
 *     * 
 *     * 
 *     * 
  *****  
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
In this program, we have used the simple logic of iteration over lines to create the pattern G. Please look at the image below which represents the pattern G in the form of a 2-d matrix, where mat[i][j] = ‘ij’: 
 

G

If we try to analyze this picture with a (row, column) matrix and the circles represent the position of stars in the pattern G, we will learn the steps. Here we are performing the operations column-wise. So for the first line of stars, we set the first if condition, where the row position with 0 and (n-1) won’t get the stars and all other rows from 1 to (n-1), will get the stars. Similarly, for the second, third and fourth column we want stars at the position row = 0 and row = (n-1). The other steps are self-explanatory and can be understood from the position of rows and columns in the diagram.
Below is the implementation of above idea: 
 

Python
# Python program to print pattern G
def Pattern(line):
    pat=""
    for i in range(0,line):    
        for j in range(0,line):     
            if ((j == 1 and i != 0 and i != line-1) or ((i == 0 or
                i == line-1) and j > 1 and j < line-2) or (i == ((line-1)/2)
                and j > line-5 and j < line-1) or (j == line-2 and
                i != 0 and i != line-1 and i >=((line-1)/2))):  
                pat=pat+"*"   
            else:      
                pat=pat+" "   
        pat=pat+"
"   
    return pat
   
# Driver Code
line = 7
print(Pattern(line))
Output: 
 

  ***  
 *     
 *     
 * *** 
 *   * 
 *   * 
  ***  
Time Complexity: O(n2), where n represents the given input.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), no extra space is required, so it is a constant.
