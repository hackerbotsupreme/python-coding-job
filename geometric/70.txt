Problem – Find the vertex, focus and directrix of a parabola when the coefficients of its equation are given.
A set of points on a plain surface that forms a curve such that any point on that curve is equidistant from the focus is a parabola. 
Vertex of a parabola is the coordinate from which it takes the sharpest turn whereas a is the straight line used to generate the curve.

The standard form of a parabola equation is y=ax^2+bx+c    . Given the values of a, b and c; our task is to find the coordinates of vertex, focus and the equation of the directrix. 
Example – 
 

Input : 5 3 2
Output : Vertex:(-0.3, 1.55)
         Focus: (-0.3, 1.6)
         Directrix: y=-198
Consult the formula below for explanation.
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
This problem is a simple example of implementations of formulae. Given below are the required set of formulae which will help us tackle the problem. 
 

For a parabola in the form y=ax^2+bx+cVertex: (-b/2a, 4ac-b^2/4a)Focus: (-b/2a, 4ac-b^2+1/4a)Directrix: y=c-(b^2+1)4a

# Function to calculate Vertex,
# Focus and Directrix
def parabola(a, b, c):
 
    print("Vertex: (" , (-b / (2 * a)),
        ", ", (((4 * a * c) - (b * b))
            / (4 * a)), ")", sep = "")
               
    print("Focus: (" , (-b / (2 * a)),
    ", ", (((4 * a * c) - (b * b) + 1)
            / (4 * a)), ")", sep = "")
                
    print("Directrix: y=", c - ((b * b)
                + 1) * 4 * a, sep = "")
