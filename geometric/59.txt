Cuboid is a 3-dimensional box-like figure represented in the 3-dimensional plane.Cuboid has 6 rectangled-shape faces. Each face meet another face at 90 degree each.Three sides of cuboid meet at same vertex.Since it is made up of 6 rectangle faces, it have length, width and height of different dimension.
 

cuboid

Examples : 
 

Input : 2 3 4
Output : Area = 24
         Total Surface Area = 52 
  

Input : 5 6 12
Output : Area = 360
         Total Surface Area = 324
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Formulae : 
 

Area = l*w*h
Total Surface Area = 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*l*h
where l, h, w are length, height and width of
cuboid respectively.
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find volume and
# total surface area of cuboid
 
# utility function
def volumeCuboid( l , h , w ):
    return (l * h * w)
     
def surfaceAreaCuboid( l , h , w ):
    return (2 * l * w + 2 * w * h + 2 * l * h)
 
# driver function
l = 1
h = 5
w = 7
print("Volume =" , volumeCuboid(l, h, w))
print("Total Surface Area =", surfaceAreaCuboid(l, h, w))
