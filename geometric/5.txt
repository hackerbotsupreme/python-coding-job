def pattern(n):
    
    # For printing the upper part of pyramid
    for i in range (1, n+1):
        for j in range (1, i+1):
            print (" *",end=" ")
        print()
     
    # for printing the middle and lower part of pyramid
    for i in range (n, 1, -1):
        for j in range (i, 1, -1):
            print (" *",end=" ")
