Given diameter and height, find the perimeter of a cylinder.
Perimeter is the length of the outline of a two – dimensional shape. A cylinder is a three – dimensional shape. So, technically we cannot find the perimeter of a cylinder but we can find the perimeter of the cross-section of the cylinder. This can be done by creating the projection on its base, thus, creating the projection on its side, then the shape would be reduced to a rectangle.
 

perimeter of a cylinder

Formula : 
Perimeter of cylinder ( P ) = ( 2 * d ) + ( 2 * h )   
here d is the diameter of the cylinder 
h is the height of the cylinder
Examples : 
 

Input : diameter = 5, height = 10 
Output : Perimeter = 30

Input : diameter = 50, height = 150 
Output : Perimeter = 400
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.

# Function to calculate
# the perimeter of a cylinder
def perimeter( diameter, height ) :
    return 2 * ( diameter + height )
 
# Driver function
diameter = 5 ;
height = 10 ;
print ("Perimeter = ",
            perimeter(diameter, height))
