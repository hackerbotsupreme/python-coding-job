A rectangle is a flat figure in a plane. It has four sides and four equal angles of 90 degree each. In rectangle all four sides are not of equal length like square, sides opposite to each other have equal length. Both diagonals of the rectangle have equal length.



Examples:  

Input : 4 5
Output : Area = 20
         Perimeter = 18

Input : 2 3
Output : Area = 6
         Perimeter = 10
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
