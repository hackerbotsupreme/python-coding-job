Given two coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and m and n, find the co-ordinates that divides the line joining (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the ratio m : n
 

Section formula problems

Examples: 
 

Input : x1 = 1, y1 = 0, x2 = 2 y2 = 5,
        m = 1, n = 1
Output : (1.5, 2.5)
Explanation: co-ordinates (1.5, 2.5)
divides the line in ratio 1 : 1

Input : x1 = 2, y1 = 4, x2 = 4, y2 = 6,
        m = 2, n = 3
Output : (2.8, 4.8)
Explanation: (2.8, 4.8) divides the line
in the ratio 2:3
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The section formula tells us the coordinates of the point which divides a given line segment into two parts such that their lengths are in the ratio m : n

# Python program to find point that divides
# given line in given ratio.
def section(x1, x2, y1, y2, m, n):
 
    # Applying section formula
    x = (float)((n * x1)+(m * x2))/(m + n)
    y = (float)((n * y1)+(m * y2))/(m + n)
 
    # Printing result
    print (x, y)
 
x1 = 2
x2 = 4
y1 = 4
y2 = 6
m = 2
n = 3

How does this work? 
 

Section formula working

 

From our diagram, we can see,
PS = x – x1 and RT = x2 – x

We are given,

PR/QR = m/n

Using similarity, we can write
RS/QT = PS/RT = PR/QR

Therefore, we can write
 PS/RR = m/n
 (x - x1) / (x2 - x) = m/n

From above, we get
  x = (mx2 + nx1) / (m + n)

Similarly, we can solve for y.
