Given a number N which denotes the number of rows, the task is to follow the below pattern to print the first N rows of it.

Pattern:

*
*#
*#*
*#*#
*#*#*

Examples:

Input: N = 2
Output:
*
*#

Input: N = 6
Output: 
*
*#
*#*
*#*#
*#*#*
*#*#*#

Recommended Practice
Please try your approach on IDE first, before moving on to the solution.
Try It!
Approach: Follow the below steps to implement the above pattern:



Initialize two variables row and col to 1. These will be used to keep track of the current row and column that we are on in the pattern.
Use a loop to iterate the row from 1 to N. This will be the outer loop and will represent each row of the pattern.
Inside the outer loop, use another loop to iterate col from 1 to row. This will be the inner loop and will represent each column in the current row.
Inside the inner loop, check if col is even or odd.
If it is even, print a “#” character. If it is odd, print a “*” character.
After the inner loop has been completed, move to the next line (this will start a new row in the pattern).
After the outer loop has been completed, the pattern has been printed.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C++
Python3
# Python code for the above approach:
 
n = 6
 
# Loop through each row of
# the pattern
for row in range(1, n+1):
 
    # Loop through each column of
    # the pattern
    for col in range(1, row+1):
 
        # If the column number is even,
        # print a "#" character
        if col % 2 == 0:
            print("#", end="")
 
        # If the column number is odd,
        # print a "*" character
        else:
            print("*", end="")
 
    # Move to the next line after
    # printing each row
    print()

Output
*
*#
*#*
*#*#
*#*#*
*#*#*#
Time Complexity: O(N2)
