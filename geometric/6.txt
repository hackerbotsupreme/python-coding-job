Given a number n, write a program to print a diamond shape with 2n rows.
Examples : 
 

diamond

 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python program to
# print Diamond shape
 
# Function to print
# Diamond shape
def Diamond(rows):
    n = 0
    for i in range(1, rows + 1):
        # loop to print spaces
        for j in range (1, (rows - i) + 1):
            print(end = " ")
         
        # loop to print star
        while n != (2 * i - 1):
            print("*", end = "")
            n = n + 1
        n = 0
         
        # line break
        print()
 
    k = 1
    n = 1
    for i in range(1, rows):
        # loop to print spaces
        for j in range (1, k + 1):
            print(end = " ")
        k = k + 1
         
        # loop to print star
        while n <= (2 * (rows - i) - 1):
            print("*", end = "")
            n = n + 1
        n = 1
        print()
 
# Driver Code
# number of rows input
rows = 5
Diamond(rows)

Time Complexity: O(n*n) since we are traversing rows and columns of a grid for printing spaces ‘ ‘ and star ‘*’.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), No extra Space used.

Approach2: Solving the problem using Recursion
Implementation:



C++
Java
Python3
def gotonextLine(k, i, z):
  # base case
    if (k == i):
      return
    print("* ", end=""),
    gotonextLine(k + z, i, z)
 
# print blank space of diamond
def addblankSpaceInDiamond(j,i,z):
    if (j == i):
      return
    print(" ",end=""),
    addblankSpaceInDiamond(j + z, i, z)
 
def upperDiamond(row,i):
  # base case
    if (i > row):
      return
    addblankSpaceInDiamond(row, i, -1)
    gotonextLine(0, i, 1)
    print("\n",end=""),
    upperDiamond(row, i + 1) # recursive call
 
 
def lowerDiamond(row,i):
  # print the next line of diamond
    if (i > row): # base case
      return
    addblankSpaceInDiamond(0, i, 1)
    gotonextLine(row, i, -1)
    print("\n",end=""),
    lowerDiamond(row, i + 1)
 
# Code
row = 5
upperDiamond(row, 0) # print uper part of triangle
lowerDiamond(row, 1) # print lower part of diamond

Time Complexity: O(N2), Since we are traversing rows and columns of a grid for printing spaces ‘ ‘ and star ‘*’.
Auxiliary Space: O(N), The extra space is used in recursion call stack.
