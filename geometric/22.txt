Given the sides of a triangle, the task is to find the area of this triangle.
Examples : 

Input : a = 5, b = 7, c = 8
Output : Area of a triangle is 17.320508


Input : a = 3, b = 4, c = 5
Output : Area of a triangle is 6.000000

Approach: The area of a triangle can simply be evaluated using following formula. 

Area = \sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))

where a, b and c are lengths of sides of triangle, and 
s = (a+b+c)/2

Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python Program to find the area
# of triangle
 
# Length of sides must be positive
# and sum of any two sides
def findArea(a,b,c):
 
    # must be smaller than third side.
    if (a < 0 or b < 0 or c < 0 or (a+b <= c) or (a+c <=b) or (b+c <=a) ):
        print('Not a valid triangle')
        return
         
    # calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
     
    # calculate the area
    area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
    print('Area of a triangle is %f' %area)
 
 
# Initialize first side of triangle
a = 3.0
# Initialize second side of triangle
b = 4.0
# Initialize Third side of triangle
c = 5.0
findArea(a,b,c)

Auxiliary Space: O(1), since no extra space has been taken.

Given the coordinates of the vertices of a triangle, the task is to find the area of this triangle.
Approach: If given coordinates of three corners, we can apply the Shoelace formula for the area below.  

Area = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{(i+1)}+x_ny_{1}) - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(x_{(i+1)}y_i-x_1y_n)}{2}

= \frac{(x_{1}y_{2} + x_{2}y_{3} + ... + x_{n-1}y_{n} + x_{n}y_{1}) -(x_{2}y_{1} + x_{3}y_{2} + ... + x_{n}y_{n-1} + x_{1}y_{n})}{2}

C++
Java
Python3
# Python 3 program to evaluate
# area of a polygon using
# shoelace formula
 
# (X[i], Y[i]) are coordinates of i'th point.
def polygonArea(X,Y, n) :
 
    # Initialize area
    area = 0.0
   
    # Calculate value of shoelace formula
    j = n - 1
    for i in range( 0, n) :
        area = area + (X[j] + X[i]) * (Y[j] - Y[i])
        j = i  # j is previous vertex to i
     
     
    # Return absolute value
    return abs(area // 2.0)
 
   
# Driver program to test above function
X = [0, 2, 4]
Y = [1, 3, 7]
 
n = len(X)
print(polygonArea(X, Y, n))
