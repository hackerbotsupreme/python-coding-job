Given radius of sphere, calculate the volume and surface area of sphere.
Sphere: 
Just like a circle, which geometrically is a two-dimensional object, a sphere is defined mathematically as the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point, but in three-dimensional space. This distance r is the radius of the sphere, and the given point is the center of the sphere. 
For a given surface area, the sphere is the one solid that has the greatest volume. This why it appears in nature so much, such as water drops, bubbles and planets etc.
Volume Of Sphere: 
The number of cubic units that will exactly fill a sphere or the storage capacity of sphere. We can calculate the volume of sphere by using formula: 
 

Volume Of Sphere

Surface Area Of Sphere: 
The surface area of a sphere object is a measure of the total area that the surface of the sphere occupies. We can calculate the volume of sphere by using formula: 
 

Surface area Of Sphere

Examples : 
 

Input  : Radius Of Sphere = 5
Output : Volume    Of    Sphere :  523.5987755982989
         Surface Area Of Sphere :  314.1592653589793
Explanation:
         Volume =( 4/3 ) * 3.14159 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 523.598
         Surface Area = 4 * 3.14159 * 5 * 5 =314.159
       

Input  : Radius Of Sphere = 12
Output : Volume    Of    Sphere :  7238.229473870883
         Surface Area Of Sphere :  1809.5573684677208
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
