Given four sides of quadrilateral a, b, c, d, find the maximum area of the quadrilateral possible from the given sides .
Examples: 
 

Input : 1 2 1 2
Output : 2.00
It is optimal to construct a rectangle for maximum area .
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 



According to Bretschneider’s formula, the area of a general quadrilateral is given by K={\sqrt {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)-abcd\cdot \cos ^{2}\left({\frac {\alpha +\gamma }{2}}\right)}}        
Here a, b, c, d are the sides of a quadrilateral, s is the semiperimeter of a quadrilateral and angles are two opposite angles. 
So, this formula is maximized only when opposite angles sum to pi(180) then we can use a simplified form of Bretschneider’s formula to get the (maximum) area K. 
K={\sqrt {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}}        
This formula is called as Brahmagupta’s formula . 
Below is the implementation of given approach
 

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find maximum
# area of a quadrilateral
import math
 
def maxArea (a , b , c , d ):
 
    # Calculating the semi-perimeter
    # of the given quadrilateral
    semiperimeter = (a + b + c + d) / 2
     
    # Applying Brahmagupta's formula to
    # get maximum area of quadrilateral
    return math.sqrt((semiperimeter - a) *
                    (semiperimeter - b) *
                    (semiperimeter - c) *
                    (semiperimeter - d))
 
# Driver code
a = 1
b = 2
c = 1
d = 2
print("%.2f"%maxArea(a, b, c, d))

Time Complexity: O(logn) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)



Please suggest if someone has a better solution which is more efficient in terms of space and time.
