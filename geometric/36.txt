Given radius of a circle, write a program to find its circumference.
Examples : 
 

Input : 2
Output : Circumference = 12.566

Input : 8
Output : Circumference = 50.264
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
In a circle, points lie in the boundary of a circle are at same distance from its center. This distance is called radius. Circumference of a circle can simply be evaluated using following formula. 
 

Circumference = 2*pi*r
where r is the radius of circle 
and value of pi = 3.1415.
 



 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find
# circumference of circle
 
PI = 3.1415
 
# utility function
def circumference(r):
    return (2 * PI * r)
 
 
# driver function
print ('%.3f' % circumference(5))

Javascript
Output : 



Circumference = 31.415
Time Complexity: O(1), since there is no loop or recursion.

Auxiliary Space: O(1), since no extra space has been taken.
