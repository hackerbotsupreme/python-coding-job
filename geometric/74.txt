Given a matrix of N rows and M columns, consist of 0’s and 1’s. The task is to find the perimeter of subfigure consisting only 1’s in the matrix. Perimeter of single 1 is 4 as it can be covered from all 4 side. Perimeter of double 11 is 6. 

     
                            
|  1  |           |  1    1  |
                            
Examples:  

Input : mat[][] = 
               {
                 1, 0,
                 1, 1,
               }
Output : 8
Cell (1,0) and (1,1) making a L shape whose perimeter is 8.

Input :  mat[][] = 
                {   
                    0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
                    1, 1, 1, 0, 0,
                    1, 0, 0, 0, 0
                }
Output : 12

The idea is to traverse the matrix, find all ones and find their contribution in perimeter. The maximum contribution of a 1 is four if it is surrounded by all 0s. The contribution reduces by one with 1 around it. 

Algorithm for solving this problem: 

Traverse the whole matrix and find the cell having value equal to 1.
Calculate the number of closed side for that cell and add, 4 – number of closed side to the total perimeter.
Below is the implementation of this approach: 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find perimeter of area
# covered by 1 in 2D matrix consists of 0's and 1's.
 
R = 3
C = 5
 
# Find the number of covered side for mat[i][j].
def numofneighbour(mat, i, j):
 
    count = 0;
 
    # UP
    if (i > 0 and mat[i - 1][j]):
        count+= 1;
 
    # LEFT
    if (j > 0 and mat[i][j - 1]):
        count+= 1;
 
    # DOWN
    if (i < R-1 and mat[i + 1][j]):
        count+= 1
 
    # RIGHT
    if (j < C-1 and mat[i][j + 1]):
        count+= 1;
 
    return count;
 
# Returns sum of perimeter of shapes formed with 1s
def findperimeter(mat):
 
    perimeter = 0;
 
    # Traversing the matrix and finding ones to
    # calculate their contribution.
    for i in range(0, R):
        for j in range(0, C):
            if (mat[i][j]):
                perimeter += (4 - numofneighbour(mat, i, j));
 
    return perimeter;
 
# Driver Code
mat = [ [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] ]
 
print(findperimeter(mat), end="\n");
