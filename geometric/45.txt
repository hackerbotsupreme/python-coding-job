Given two positive integers n and m. The task is to count number of parallelogram that can be formed of any size when n horizontal parallel lines intersect with m vertical parallel lines. 
 



Examples: 
 

Input : n = 3, m = 2
Output : 3
2 parallelograms of size 1x1 and 1 parallelogram 
of size 2x1.

Input : n = 5, m = 5
Output : 100
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to use Combination, which state, number of ways to choose k items from given n items is given by nCr. 
To form a parallelogram, we need two horizontal parallel lines and two vertical parallel lines. So, number of ways to choose two horizontal parallel lines are nC2 and number of ways to choose two vertical parallel lines are mC2. So, total number of possible parallelogram will be nC2 x mC2.
Below is C++ implementation of this approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python Program to find number of parallelogram when
# n horizontal parallel lines intersect m vertical
# parallel lines.
MAX = 10;
 
# Find value of Binomial Coefficient
def binomialCoeff(C, n, k):
     
    # Calculate value of Binomial Coefficient
    # in bottom up manner
    for i in range(n + 1):
        for j in range(0, min(i, k) + 1):
         
            # Base Cases
            if (j == 0 or j == i):
                C[i][j] = 1;
 
            # Calculate value using previously
            # stored values
            else:
                C[i][j] = C[i - 1][j - 1] + C[i - 1][j];
 
# Return number of parallelogram when n horizontal
# parallel lines intersect m vertical parallel lines.
def countParallelogram(n, m):
    C = [[0 for i in range(MAX)] for j in range(MAX)]
 
    binomialCoeff(C, max(n, m), 2);
 
    return C[n][2] * C[m][2];
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = 5;
    m = 5;
    print(countParallelogram(n, m));

100
Time Complexity: O(n2) 
Auxiliary Space: O(n2)
Please suggest if someone has a better solution which is more efficient in terms of space and time.
