Given n > 3, find number of diagonals in n sided convex polygon.
According to Wikipedia, In geometry, a diagonal is a line segment joining two vertices of a polygon or polyhedron, when those vertices are not on the same edge. Informally, any sloping line is called diagonal.

Examples : 

Input : 5
Output : 5
Explanation: Five possible diagonals are : AC, AD, BD, BE, CE

Since for an n-sided convex polygon, from each vertex, we can draw n-3 diagonals leaving two adjacent vertices and itself. Following this way for n-vertices, there will be n*(n-3) diagonals but then we will be calculating each diagonal twice so total number of diagonals become n*(n-3)/2
Here is code for above formula.

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find number of diagonals
# in n sided convex polygon
def numberOfDiagonals(n):
    return n * (n - 3) / 2
 
  
# driver code to test above function
def main():
    n = 5
    print(n , " sided convex polygon have ")
    print(numberOfDiagonals(n) , " diagonals")
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
