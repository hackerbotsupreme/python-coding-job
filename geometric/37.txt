Given the radius of a circle, find the area of that circle.

The area of a circle can simply be evaluated using the following formula.
 

Area-of-circle

 

Area = \pi r^2

where r is radius of circle and it maybe in float because value of pie is 3.14 

 
Approach: Using the given radius, find the area using the above formula: (pi * r * r) and print the result in float.

C
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find Area of a circle
 
def findArea(r):
    PI = 3.142
    return PI * (r*r);
 
# Driver method
print("Area is %.6f" % findArea(5));
