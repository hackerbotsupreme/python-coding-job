Given slant height, height and radius of a frustum of a cone, we have to calculate the volume and surface area of the frustum of a cone.

Frustum of cone
In geometry, a frustum is the portion of a solid (normally a cone or pyramid) that lies between one or two parallel planes cutting it.
If we cut a right circular cone by a plane parallel to its base, the portion of the solid between this plane and the base is known as the frustum of a cone.

Given below is a right circular cone.


The right circular cone after being cut by a plane parallel to its base results in a frustum as follows:


which has a circular base at bottom of radius R
circular upper portion with radius r
height h
and slant height l

Volume of frustum of cone:
Volume (V) = 1/3 * pi * h(r2 + R2 + r*R)

where
r = radius of smaller circle
R = radius of bigger circle (or radius of base of the cone)
h = height of the frustum
Curved Surface Area of frustum of cone:
Curved Surface Area (CSA) = pi * l(R + r)

where
r = radius of smaller circle
R = radius of bigger circle
l = slant height of the frustum
TotalSurface Area of frustum of cone:
Total Surface Area (TSA) = pi * l(R + r) + pi(R2 + r2)

where
r = radius of smaller circle
R = radius of bigger circle
l = slant height of frustum
Examples:

Input : Radius of smaller circle = 3
        Radius of bigger circle = 8
        Height of frustum = 12
        Slant height of frustum = 13
Output :
Volume Of Frustum of Cone : 1218.937
Curved Surface Area Of Frustum of Cone : 449.24738
Total Surface Area Of Frustum of Cone : 678.58344


Input : Radius of smaller circle = 7
        Radius of bigger circle = 10
        Height of frustum = 4
        Slant height of frustum = 5

Output :
Volume Of Frustum of Cone : 917.34436
Curved Surface Area Of Frustum of Cone : 267.03516
Total Surface Area Of Frustum of Cone : 735.1321
