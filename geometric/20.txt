Given three sides, check whether triangle is valid or not. 
Examples: 
 

Input :  a = 7, b = 10, c = 5 
Output : Valid

Input : a = 1 b = 10 c = 12 
Output : Invalid
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: A triangle is valid if sum of its two sides is greater than the third side. If three sides are a, b and c, then three conditions should be met. 
 

1.a + b > c 
2.a + c > b 
3.b + c > a  
 

Check whether triangle is valid or not if sides are given

 

C++
// C++ program to check if three sides form a triangle or not
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// function to check if three sider form a triangle or not
bool checkValidity(int a, int b, int c)
{
    // check condition
    if (a + b <= c || a + c <= b || b + c <= a)
        return false;
    else
        return true;
}
 
// Driver function
int main()
{
    int a = 7, b = 10, c = 5;
    if (checkValidity(a, b, c))
        cout << "Valid";
    else
        cout << "Invalid";
}
