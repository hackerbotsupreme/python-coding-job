Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.
Note that a rectangle can be represented by two coordinates, top left and bottom right. So mainly we are given following four coordinates. 
l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle. 
r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle. 
l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle. 
r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.

We need to write a function bool doOverlap(l1, r1, l2, r2) that returns true if the two given rectangles overlap.

Note : It may be assumed that the rectangles are parallel to the coordinate axis.
One solution is to one by one pick all points of one rectangle and see if the point lies inside the other rectangle or not. This can be done using the algorithm discussed here. 
Following is a simpler approach. Two rectangles do not overlap if one of the following conditions is true. 
1) One rectangle is above top edge of other rectangle. 
2) One rectangle is on left side of left edge of other rectangle.
We need to check above cases to find out if given rectangles overlap or not. Following is the implementation of the above approach. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python program to check if rectangles overlap
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
 
# Returns true if two rectangles(l1, r1)
# and (l2, r2) overlap
def do_overlap(l1, r1, l2, r2):
     
    # if rectangle has area 0, no overlap
    if l1.x == r1.x or l1.y == r1.y or r2.x == l2.x or l2.y == r2.y:
        return False
     
    # If one rectangle is on left side of other
    if l1.x > r2.x or l2.x > r1.x:
        return False
 
    # If one rectangle is above other
    if r1.y > l2.y or r2.y > l1.y:
        return False
 
    return True
 
# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    l1 = Point(0, 10)
    r1 = Point(10, 0)
    l2 = Point(5, 5)
    r2 = Point(15, 0)
 
    if(do_overlap(l1, r1, l2, r2)):
        print("Rectangles Overlap")
    else:
        print("Rectangles Don't Overlap")

The Time Complexity of the above code is O(1) as the code doesnâ€™t have any loop or recursion.
