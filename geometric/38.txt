We have a circle centered at origin (0, 0). As input we are given with starting angle of the circle sector and the size of the circle sector in percentage. 

Examples: 

Input :  Radius = 8 
         StartAngle = 0 
         Percentage = 12 
         x = 3 y = 4 
Output : Point (3, 4) exists in the circle 
         sector

Input : Radius = 12 
        Startangle = 45
        Percentage = 25  
        x = 3 y = 4 
Output : Point (3, 4) does not exist in 
         the circle sector

In this image starting angle is 0 degree, radius r and suppose that percentage of colored area is 12% then we calculate Ending Angle as 360/percentage + starting angle.

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
To find whether a point (x, y) exists in a circle sector (centered at origin) or not we find polar coordinates of that point and then go through the following steps:

Convert x, y to polar coordinates using this 
Angle = atan(y/x); Radius = sqrt(x * x + y * y);
Then Angle must be between StartingAngle and EndingAngle, and Radius between 0 and your Radius.

# Python3 program to check if a point
# lies inside a circle sector.
import math
 
def checkPoint(radius, x, y, percent, startAngle):
 
    # calculate endAngle
    endAngle = 360 / percent + startAngle
 
    # Calculate polar co-ordinates
    polarradius = math.sqrt(x * x + y * y)
    Angle = math.atan(y / x)
 
    # Check whether polarradius is less
    # then radius of circle or not and
    # Angle is between startAngle and
    # endAngle or not
    if (Angle >= startAngle and Angle <= endAngle
                        and polarradius < radius):
        print("Point (", x, ",", y, ") "
              "exist in the circle sector")
    else:
        print("Point (", x, ",", y, ") "
              "does not exist in the circle sector")
