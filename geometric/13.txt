Given two coordinates, find the slope of a straight line.

Examples: 

Input  : x1 = 4, y1 = 2, 
         x2 = 2, y2 = 5 
Output : Slope is -1.5
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: To calculate the slope of a line you need only two points from that line, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The equation used to calculate the slope from two points is: 
 



Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

C++
Java
Python
# Python program for slope of line
def slope(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    if(x2 - x1 != 0):
      return (float)(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)
    return sys.maxint
 
 
# driver code
x1 = 4
y1 = 2
x2 = 2
y2 = 5
print "Slope is:", slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output
Slope is: -1.5
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
