A shape is equable if its area is equal to its perimeter. Given ordered coordinates of polygon find whether the shape is equable or not.

Examples : 

Input : X[] = {0, 5, 0}
        Y[] = {0, 0, 12}
Output : Equable Shape

Input : X[] = {0, 4, 4, 0}
        Y[] = {0, 0, 4, 4}
Output : Equable Shape

Input: X[] = {0, 6, 6, 0}
       Y[] = {0, 0, 4, 4}
Output: Not Equable Shape
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We can find area of polygon using shoelace formula which is described in Area of a polygon with given n ordered vertices. We can also find its perimeter simply by adding distances between adjacent points.

# Python 3 program to find equable shape
# To calculate area of polygon
 
import math
def polygonArea(X, Y, n):
    area = 0.0
  
    # Calculate value of area
    # using shoelace  formula
    j = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        area += (X[j] + X[i]) * (Y[j] - Y[i])
 
        # j is previous vertex to i
        j = i 
    return abs(area / 2.0)
  
# To calculate perimeter of polygon
def polygonPerimeter(X, Y, n):
    perimeter = 0.0
  
    # Calculate value of perimeter
    j = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        perimeter += math.sqrt((X[j] - X[i]) * (X[j] - X[i]) +
                          (Y[j] - Y[i]) * (Y[j] - Y[i]))
 
        # j is previous vertex to i
        j = i 
 
    return perimeter
  
# To find equable shape
def equableShape(X, Y, n):
    # Find area and perimeter of polygon if
    # they are equal then it is equable shape
    if (polygonPerimeter(X, Y, n) == polygonArea(X, Y, n)):
        print("Equable Shape")
    else:
        print("Not Equable Shape")
 
#  Driver program to test above function
X = [ 0, 5, 0 ]
Y = [ 0, 0, 12 ]
n = len(X)
equableShape(X, Y, n)
