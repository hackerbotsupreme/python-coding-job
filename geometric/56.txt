A pyramid is a 3-dimensional geometric shape formed by connecting all the corners of a polygon to a central apex. 
There are many types of pyramids. Most often, they are named after the type of base they have. Letâ€™s look at some common types of pyramids below. 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 

Volume of a square pyramid [base of Pyramid is square] = (1/3) * (b^2) * h 
Volume of a triangular pyramid [base of Pyramid is triangle] = (1/6) * a * b * h 
Volume of a pentagonal pyramid [base of Pyramid is pentagonal] = (5/6) * a * b * h 
Volume of a hexagonal pyramid [base of Pyramid is hexagonal] = a * b * h

Below is code for calculating volume of Pyramids : 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to Volume of Pyramid
 
# Function to calculate
# Volume of Triangular Pyramid
def volumeTriangular(a, b, h):
    return (0.1666) * a * b * h
 
# Function To calculate
# Volume of Square Pyramid
def volumeSquare(b, h):
    return (0.33) * b * b * h
 
# Function To calculate Volume
# of Pentagonal Pyramid
def volumePentagonal(a, b, h):
    return (0.83) * a * b * h
 
# Function To calculate Volume
# of Hexagonal Pyramid
def volumeHexagonal(a, b, h):
    return a * b * h
 
 
# Driver Code
b = float(4)
h = float(9)
a = float(4)
print( "Volume of triangular base pyramid is ",
                    volumeTriangular(a, b, h) )
print( "Volume of square base pyramid is ",
                    volumeSquare(b, h) )
print( "Volume of pentagonal base pyramid is ",
                    volumePentagonal(a,b, h) )
print( "Volume of Hexagonal base pyramid is ",
                    volumeHexagonal(a, b, h))
