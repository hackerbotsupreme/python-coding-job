# Function definition
def pattern(rows_no):
 
    # for loop for printing upper half
    for i in range(1, rows_no + 1):
 
        # printing i spaces at the
        # beginning of each row
        for k in range(1, i):
            print(" ", end = "")
         
        # printing i to rows value
        # at the end of each row
        for j in range(i, rows_no + 1):
            print(j, end = " ")
 
        print()
     
    # for loop for printing lower half
    for i in range(rows_no - 1, 0, -1):

        # beginning of each row

Output : 
 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7
 2 3 4 5 6 7
  3 4 5 6 7
   4 5 6 7
    5 6 7
     6 7 
      7
     6 7
    5 6 7
   4 5 6 7
  3 4 5 6 7
 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Time Complexity : O(rows_no*rows_no) ,where rows_no is rows value taken from user.

Space Complexity : O(1) ,as we are not using any extra space.
