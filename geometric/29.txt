Given the length of sides of an equilateral triangle. We need to write a program to find the area of Circumcircle of the given equilateral triangle.
Examples: 
 

Input : side = 6
Output : Area of circumscribed circle is: 37.69

Input : side = 9
Output : Area of circumscribed circle is: 84.82 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
All three sides of equilateral triangle are of equal length and all three interior angles are 60 degrees.
Properties of a Circumcircle are as follows: 
 

The center of the circumcircle is the point where the medians of the equilateral triangle intersect.
Circumscribed circle of an equilateral triangle is made through the three vertices of an equilateral triangle.
The radius of a circumcircle of an equilateral triangle is equal to (a / √3), where ‘a’ is the length of the side of equilateral triangle.
Below image shows an equilateral triangle with circumcircle: 
 



The formula used to calculate the area of circumscribed circle is: 
 

(π*a2)/3
where a is the length of the side of the given equilateral triangle.
 



How this formulae works?

We know that area of circle = π*r2, where r is the radius of given circle.
We also know that radius of Circumcircle of an equilateral triangle = (side of the equilateral triangle)/ √3.
Therefore, area = π*r2 = π*a2/3.

# Python3 code to find the area of circumscribed
# circle of equilateral triangle
PI = 3.14159265
     
# Function to find the area of
# circumscribed circle
def area_circumscribed(a):
    return (a * a * (PI / 3))
     
# Driver code
a = 6.0
print("Area of circumscribed circle is :%f"
                        %area_circumscribed(a))

Output: 
Area of circumscribed circle is :37.6991118
 

Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1), since no extra space has been taken.
