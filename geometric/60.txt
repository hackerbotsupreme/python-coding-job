Cube is a 3-dimensional box-like figure represented in the 3-dimensional plane. Cube has 6 squared-shape equal faces. Each face meet another face at 90 degree each. Three sides of cube meet at same vertex. 
 

cube

Examples: 
 

Input : Side of a cube = 2
Output : Area = 8
         Total surface area = 24

Input : Side of a cube = 3
Output : Area = 27
         Total surface area = 54
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 

Volume: a*a*a 
Total Surface area: 6*a*a

Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find area
# and total surface area of cube
 
# utility function
def areaCube( a ):
    return (a * a * a)
 
def surfaceCube( a ):
    return (6 * a * a)
 
# driver function
a = 5
print("Area =", areaCube(a))
print("Total surface area =", surfaceCube(a))

Javascript
Output: 
 

Area = 125
Total surface area = 150
Time complexity : O(1) 
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
