This is basically a variation of bubble-sort. This algorithm is divided into two phases- Odd and Even Phase. The algorithm runs until the array elements are sorted and in each iteration two phases occurs- Odd and Even Phases.
In the odd phase, we perform a bubble sort on odd indexed elements and in the even phase, we perform a bubble sort on even indexed elements.

# Python Program to implement 
# Odd-Even / Brick Sort
  
def oddEvenSort(arr, n):
    # Initially array is unsorted
    isSorted = 0
    while isSorted == 0:
        isSorted = 1
        temp = 0
        for i in range(1, n-1, 2):
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                isSorted = 0
                  
        for i in range(0, n-1, 2):
            if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:
                arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
                isSorted = 0
      
    return
  
  
arr = [34, 2, 10, -9]
n = len(arr)
  
oddEvenSort(arr, n);
for i in range(0, n):
    print(arr[i], end = ' ')

We demonstrate the above algorithm using the below illustration on the array = {3, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 4, 1}
 



Please refer wiki for proof of correctness.
Time Complexity : O(N2) where, N = Number of elements in the input array.
Auxiliary Space : O(1). Just like bubble sort this is also an in-place algorithm.
Exercise 
In our program in each iteration we first do bubble sort on odd indexed elements and then a bubble sort on the even indexed elements.
Will we get a sorted result if we first perform a bubble sort on even indexed element first and then on the odd indexed element ?
