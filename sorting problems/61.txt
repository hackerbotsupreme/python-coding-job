Given an Array, three operations can be performed using any external number x.

Add x to an element once
Subtract x from an element once
Perform no operation on the element
Count of unique elements is 1. Answer is YES with x = 0
Count of unique elements is 2. Answer is YES with x = Difference of two unique elements.
Count of unique elements is 3.
If difference between mid and max is same as difference between mid and min, answer is YES with x = difference between mid and max or mid and min.
Otherwise answer is NO.
In Python, we can quickly find unique elements using set in Python.

Java
Python
# Program in python 2.x to find an element X
# that can be used to operate on an array and
# get equal elements
   
# Prints "YES" and an element x if we can
# equalize array using x. Else prints "NO"
def canEqualise(array):
   
    # We all the unique elements (using set
    # function). Then we sort unique elements.
    uniques = sorted(set(array))
   
    # if there are only 1 or 2 unique elements,
    # then we can add or subtract x from one of them
    # to get the other element
    if len(uniques) == 1:
        print("YES " + "0")
    elif len(uniques) == 2:
        print("YES " + str(uniques[1] - uniques[0]))
   
    # If count of unique elements is three, then
    # difference between the middle and minimum
    # should be same as difference between maximum
    # and middle
    elif len(uniques) == 3:
        if uniques[2] - uniques[1] == uniques[1] - uniques[0]:
            X = uniques[2] - uniques[1]
            print("YES " + str(X))
        else:
            print("NO")
   
    # if there are more than three unique elements, then
    # we cannot add or subtract the same value from all
    # the elements.
    else:
        print("NO")
   
# Driver code
array = [55, 52, 52, 49, 52]

OUTPUT

YES 3
Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Auxiliary space: O(n).
