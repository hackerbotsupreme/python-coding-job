Given an array of distinct positive numbers, the task is to calculate the number of subsets (or subsequences) from the array such that each subset contains consecutive numbers.

Examples: 

Input :  arr[] = {100, 56, 5, 6, 102, 58, 
                            101, 57, 7, 103, 59}
Output : 3
{5, 6, 7}, { 56, 57, 58, 59}, {100, 101, 102, 103}
are 3 subset in which numbers are consecutive.

Input :  arr[] = {10, 100, 105}
Output : 3
{10}, {100} and {105} are 3 subset in which 
numbers are consecutive.

The idea is to sort the array and traverse the sorted array to count the number of such subsets. To count the number of such subsets, we need to count the consecutive numbers such that the difference between them is not equal to one.

Following is the algorithm for the finding number of subset containing consecutive numbers: 

1. Sort the array arr[ ] and count = 1.
2. Traverse the sorted array and for each element arr[i].
   If arr[i] + 1 != arr[i+1], 
       then increment the count by one.
3. Return the count. 
Below is the implementation of this approach :  

C++
Java
Python3
# Python program to find number of subset containing
# consecutive numbers
def numofsubset(arr, n):
 
  # Sort the array so that elements which are consecutive
  # in nature became consecutive in the array.
  x = sorted(arr)
  
  count = 1
  
  for i in range(0, n-1):
 
    # Check if there is beginning of another subset of
    # consecutive number
    if (x[i] + 1 != x[i + 1]):
      count = count + 1
  
  return count
 
# Driven Program
arr = [ 100, 56, 5, 6, 102, 58, 101, 57, 7, 103, 59 ]
n = len(arr)
print (numofsubset(arr, n))
