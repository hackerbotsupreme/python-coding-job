Given an array of n integers and a positive number k. We are allowed to take any k integers from the given array. The task is to find the minimum possible value of the difference between maximum and minimum of K numbers.

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {10, 100, 300, 200, 1000, 20, 30}
        k = 3
Output : 20
20 is the minimum possible difference between any
maximum and minimum of any k numbers.
Given k = 3, we get the result 20 by selecting 
integers {10, 20, 30}.
max(10, 20, 30) - min(10, 20, 30) = 30 - 10 = 20.

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, 30, 40, 
                                   100, 200}.
        k = 4      
Output : 3

The idea is to sort the array and choose k continuous integers. Why continuous? Let the chosen k integers be arr[0], arr[1], …arr[r], arr[r+x]…, arr[k-1], all in increasing order but not continuous in the sorted array. This means there exists an integer p which lies between arr[r] and arr[r+x],. So if p is included and arr[0] is removed, then the new difference will be arr[r] – arr[1] whereas old difference was arr[r] – arr[0]. And we know arr[0] ≤ arr[1] ≤ … ≤ arr[k-1] so minimum difference reduces or remains the same. If we perform the same procedure for other p like numbers, we get the minimum difference.

Algorithm to solve the problem: 

Sort the Array.
Calculate the maximum(k numbers) – minimum(k numbers) for each group of k consecutive integers.
Return minimum of all values obtained in step 2.
Below is the implementation of above idea : 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python program to find minimum
# difference of maximum
# and minimum of K number.
 
# Return minimum difference
# of maximum and minimum
# of k elements of arr[0..n-1].
def minDiff(arr,n,k):
    result = +2147483647
  
    # Sorting the array.
    arr.sort()
  
    # Find minimum value among
    # all K size subarray.
    for i in range(n-k+1):
        result = int(min(result, arr[i+k-1] - arr[i]))
  
    return result
 
# Driver code
 
arr= [10, 100, 300, 200, 1000, 20, 30]
n =len(arr)
k = 3
  
print(minDiff(arr, n, k))
