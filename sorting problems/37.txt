Given an array of strings arr[]. Sort given strings using Bubble Sort and display the sorted array.

In Bubble Sort, the two successive strings arr[i] and arr[i+1] are exchanged whenever arr[i]> arr[i+1]. The larger values sink to the bottom and hence called sinking sort. At the end of each pass, smaller values gradually “bubble” their way upward to the top and hence called bubble sort.

 After all the passes, we get all the strings in sorted order. The complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N2).

Let us look at the code snippet

C++
Java
C#
Python3
# Python Implementation
 
 
def compare(a, b):
    return ((a < b) - (a > b))
 
 
def sort_string(arr, n):
    temp = ""
 
    # Sort string using the bubble sort
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if compare(arr[j], arr[i]) > 0:
                temp = arr[j]
                arr[j] = arr[i]
                arr[i] = temp
    print("String in sorted order are: ")
    for i in range(n):
        print(f'Strings {i + 1} is {arr[i]}')
 
 
# Driver code
arr = ["GeeksforGeeks", "Quiz", "Practice", "Gblogs", "Coding"]
n = len(arr)
sort_string(arr, n)

Output
Strings in sorted order are : 
 String 1 is Coding
 String 2 is Gblogs
 String 3 is GeeksforGeeks
 String 4 is Practice
 String 5 is Quiz
