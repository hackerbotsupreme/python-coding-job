Given a natural number n, print all distinct divisors of it.

 all divisors of a natural number

Examples:

 Input : n = 10       
 Output: 1 2 5 10

 Input:  n = 100
 Output: 1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100

 Input:  n = 125
 Output: 1 5 25 125
Note that this problem is different from finding all prime factors.

A Naive Solution would be to iterate all the numbers from 1 to n, checking if that number divides n and printing it. Below is a program for the same:

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python implementation of Naive method
# to print all divisors
  
# method to print the divisors
def printDivisors(n) :
    i = 1
    while i <= n :
        if (n % i==0) :
            print (i,end=" ")
        i = i + 1
          
# Driver method
print ("The divisors of 100 are: ")
printDivisors(100)
  
#This code is contributed by Nikita Tiwari.
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output:

The divisors of 100 are: 
1 2 4 5 10 20 25 50 100
Time Complexity : O(n) 
Auxiliary Space : O(1)



Can we improve the above solution? 
If we look carefully, all the divisors are present in pairs. For example if n = 100, then the various pairs of divisors are: (1,100), (2,50), (4,25), (5,20), (10,10)
Using this fact we could speed up our program significantly. 
We, however, have to be careful if there are two equal divisors as in the case of (10, 10). In such case, weâ€™d print only one of them. 

Below is an implementation for the same:

C++
C
Java
Python3
# A Better (than Naive) Solution to find all divisors
import math 
  
# method to print the divisors
def printDivisors(n) :
      
    # Note that this loop runs till square root
    i = 1
    while i <= math.sqrt(n):
          
        if (n % i == 0) :
              
            # If divisors are equal, print only one
            if (n / i == i) :
                print (i,end=" ")
            else :
                # Otherwise print both
                print (i , int(n/i), end=" ")
        i = i + 1
  
# Driver method
print ("The divisors of 100 are: ")
printDivisors(100)
  
#This code is contributed by Nikita Tiwari.

Output:

The divisors of 100 are: 
1 100 2 50 4 25 5 20 10
Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n)) 
Auxiliary Space : O(1)

However there is still a minor problem in the solution, can you guess? 
Yes! the output is not in a sorted fashion which we had got using the brute-force technique. Please refer below for an O(sqrt(n)) time solution that prints divisors in sorted order.
