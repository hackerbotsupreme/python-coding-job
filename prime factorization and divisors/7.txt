Given a number ‘n’ and a prime number ‘p’. We need to find out the power of ‘p’ in the prime factorization of n!
Examples: 
 

Input  : n = 4, p = 2
Output : 3
         Power of 2 in the prime factorization
         of 2 in 4! = 24 is 3

Input  : n = 24, p = 2
Output : 22
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Naive approach 
The naive approach is to find the power of p in each number from 1 to n and add them. Because we know that during multiplication power is added.
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 implementation of
# finding power of p in n!
 
# Returns power of p in n!
def PowerOFPINnfactorial(n, p):
 
    # initializing answer
    ans = 0;
 
    # initializing
    temp = p;
 
    # loop until temp<=n
    while (temp <= n):
 
        # add number of numbers
        # divisible by n
        ans += n / temp;
 
        # each time multiply
        # temp by p
        temp = temp * p;
         
    return ans;
 
# Driver Code
print(PowerOFPINnfactorial(4, 2));

Efficient Approach 
Before discussing efficient approach lets discuss a question given a two numbers n, m how many numbers are there from 1 to n that are divisible by m the answer is floor(n/m). 
Now coming back to our original question to find the power of p in n! what we do is count the number of numbers from 1 to n that are divisible by p then by p^2       then by p^3       till p^k       > n and add them. This will be our required answer. 

   Powerofp(n!) = floor(n/p) + floor(n/p^2) + floor(n/p^3)........ 
Below is the implementation of the above steps.
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 implementation of
# finding power of p in n!
 
# Returns power of p in n!
def PowerOFPINnfactorial(n, p):
 
    # initializing answer
    ans = 0
 
    # initializing
    temp = p
 
    # loop until temp<=n
    while (temp <= n) :
 
        # add number of numbers
        # divisible by n
        ans += n / temp
 
        # each time multiply
        # temp by p
        temp = temp * p
     
    return int(ans)
 
# Driver Code
print(PowerOFPINnfactorial(4, 2))
