Given n integers, we need to find size of the largest subset with GCD equal to 1. 
Input Constraint : 

n <= 10^5
A[i] <= 10^5
Examples: 

Input : A = {2, 3, 5}
Output : 3

Input : A = {3, 18, 12}
Output : -1
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
 

Naive Solution :
We find GCD of all possible subsets and find the largest subset whose GCD is 1. Total time taken will be equal to the time taken to evaluate GCD of all possible subsets. Total possible subsets are 2n. In worst case there are n elements in subset and time taken to calculate its GCD will be n * log(n) 
Extra space required to hold current subset is O(n)
 

Time complexity : O(n * log(n) * 2^n)
Space Complexity : O(n)
 

Optimized O(n) solution :
Let say we find a subset with GCD 1, if we add a new element to it then GCD still remains 1. Hence if a subset exists with GCD 1 then GCD of the complete set is also 1. Hence we first find GCD of the complete set, if its 1 then complete set is that subset else no subset exist with GCD 1.

# python program to find size of the
# largest subset with GCD 1
 
# Function to return gcd of a and b
def gcd( a, b):
     
    if (a == 0):
        return b
         
    return gcd(b%a, a)
 
 
# Function to find largest subset
# with GCD 1
def largestGCD1Subset(A, n):
     
    # finding gcd of whole array
    currentGCD = A[0];
    for i in range(1, n):
         
        currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, A[i])
 
        # If current GCD becomes 1 at
        # any moment, then whole
        # array has GCD 1.
        if (currentGCD == 1):
            return n
    return 0
 
# Driver code
A = [2, 18, 6, 3]
n = len(A)
print (largestGCD1Subset(A, n))
