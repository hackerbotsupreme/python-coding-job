Given an integer n, print m increasing numbers such that the sum of m numbers is equal to n and the GCD of m numbers is maximum among all series possible. If no series is possible then print “-1”.
Examples : 
 

Input  : n = 24,
         m = 3  
Output : 4 8 12  
Explanation : (3, 6, 15) is also a series 
of m numbers which sums to N, but gcd = 3
(4, 8, 12) has gcd = 4 which is the maximum
possible.
              
Input  : n = 6 
         m = 4 
Output : -1 
Explanation: It is not possible as the 
least GCD sequence will be 1+2+3+4 which
is greater than n, hence print -1.
 

Recommended Practice
Series with largest GCD and sum equals to N
Try It!
Approach:
The most common observation is that the gcd of the series will always be a divisor of n. The maximum gcd possible (say b) will be n/sum, where sum is the sum of 1+2+..m. 
If b turns out to be 0, then the sum of 1+2+3..+k exceeds n which is invalid, hence output “-1”.
Traverse to find out all the divisors possible, a loop till sqrt(n). If the current divisor is i, the best possible way to take the series will be to consider i, 2*i, 3*i, …(m-1)*i, and their sum is s which is equal to i * (m*(m-1))/2 . The last number will be n-s. 
Along with i being the divisor, n/i will be the other divisor so check for that also.
Take maximum of possible divisor possible (say r) which should be less than or equals to b and print the sequence as r, 2*r, … (m-1)*r, n—s. 
If no such divisors are found simply output “-1”.
