The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive number that divides each of the numbers. 
Example: 
 

Input  : 0.3, 0.9
Output : 0.3

Input  : 0.48, 0.108
Output : 0.012
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The simplest approach to solve this problem is :
a=1.20 
b=22.5 
Expressing each of the numbers without decimals as the product of primes we get:
120=2^3*3*5    
2250=2*3^2*5^3    
Now, H.C.F. of 120 and 2250 = 2*3*5=30 
Therefore,the H.C.F. of 1.20 and 22.5=0.30 
(taking 2 decimal places)
We can do this using the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm indicates that if the smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number, GCD of two numbers doesnâ€™t change.

# Python code for finding the GCD of
# two floating numbers.
 
import math
 
# Recursive function to return gcd
# of a and b
def gcd(a,b) :
    if (a < b) :
        return gcd(b, a)
     
    # base case
    if (abs(b) < 0.001) :
        return a
    else :
        return (gcd(b, a - math.floor(a / b) * b))
     
      
# Driver Function.
a = 1.20
b = 22.5
print('{0:.1f}'.format(gcd(a, b)))
