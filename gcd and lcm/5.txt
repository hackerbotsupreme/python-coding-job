Given three integers x, y, z, the task is to compute the value of GCD(LCM(x,y), LCM(x,z)). 
Where, GCD = Greatest Common Divisor, LCM = Least Common Multiple
Examples: 
 

Input: x = 15, y = 20, z = 100
Output: 60

Input: x = 30, y = 40, z = 400
Output: 120

One way to solve it is by finding GCD(x, y), and using it we find LCM(x, y). Similarly, we find LCM(x, z) and then we finally find the GCD of the obtained results.
An efficient approach can be done by the fact that the following version of distributivity holds true:
GCD(LCM (x, y), LCM (x, z)) = LCM(x, GCD(y, z))
For example, GCD(LCM(3, 4), LCM(3, 10)) = LCM(3, GCD(4, 10)) = LCM(3, 2) = 6 
This reduces our work to compute the given problem statement.

Python3
# Python program to compute
# value of GCD(LCM(x,y), LCM(x,z))
 
# Recursive function to
# return gcd of a and b
def __gcd(a,b):
     
    # Everything divides 0
    if (a == 0 or b == 0):
        return 0
  
    # base case
    if (a == b):
        return a
  
    # a is greater
    if (a > b):
        return __gcd(a-b, b)
    return __gcd(a, b-a)
 
# Returns value of
#  GCD(LCM(x,y), LCM(x,z))
def findValue(x, y, z):
 
    g = __gcd(y, z)
  
    # Return LCM(x, GCD(y, z))
    return (x*g)/__gcd(x, g)
 
# driver code
x = 30
y = 40
z = 400
print("%d"%findValue(x, y, z))

Time Complexity: O(log (min(n))) 
Auxiliary Space: O(log (min(n))) 

As a side note, vice versa is also true, i.e., gcd(x, lcm(y, z)) = lcm(gcd(x, y), gcd(x, z)
