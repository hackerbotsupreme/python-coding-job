Given two strings s and t. The task is to find maximum length of some prefix of the string S which occur in string t as subsequence.

Examples : 

Input : s = "digger"
        t = "biggerdiagram"
Output : 3
digger
biggerdiagram
Prefix "dig" of s is longest subsequence in t.

Input : s = "geeksforgeeks"
        t = "agbcedfeitk"
Output : 4
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
A simple solutions is to consider all prefixes on by one and check if current prefix of s[] is a subsequence of t[] or not. Finally return length of the largest prefix.

An efficient solution is based on the fact that to find a prefix of length n, we must first find the prefix of length n – 1 and then look for s[n-1] in t. Similarly, to find a prefix of length n – 1, we must first find the prefix of length n – 2 and then look for s[n – 2] and so on. 
Thus, we keep a counter which stores the current length of prefix found. We initialize it with 0 and begin with the first letter of s and keep iterating over t to find the occurrence of the first letter. As soon as we encounter the first letter of s we update the counter and look for second letter. We keep updating the counter and looking for next letter, until either the string s is found or there are no more letters in t.

Below is the implementation of this approach: 

C++
Java
Python 3
# Python 3 program to find maximum 
# length prefix of one string occur
# as subsequence in another string.
  
  
# Return the maximum length 
# prefix which is subsequence.
def maxPrefix(s, t) :
    count = 0
  
    # Iterating string T.
    for i in range(0,len(t)) :
          
        # If end of string S.
        if (count == len(s)) :
            break
  
        # If character match, 
        # increment counter.
        if (t[i] == s[count]) :
            count = count + 1
              
  
    return count
  
  
# Driver Code
S = "digger"
T = "biggerdiagram"
  
print(maxPrefix(S, T))
