Given an integer n and a prime number p, find the largest x such that px (p raised to power x) divides n! (factorial) 
Examples: 
 

Input:  n = 7, p = 3
Output: x = 2
32 divides 7! and 2 is the largest such power of 3.

Input:  n = 10, p = 3
Output: x = 4
34 divides 10! and 4 is the largest such power of 3.
 

Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.
n! is multiplication of {1, 2, 3, 4, …n}.
How many numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, ….. n} are divisible by p? 
Every p’th number is divisible by p in {1, 2, 3, 4, ….. n}. Therefore in n!, there are ⌊n/p⌋ numbers divisible by p. So we know that the value of x (largest power of p that divides n!) is at-least ⌊n/p⌋. 
Can x be larger than ⌊n/p⌋ ? 
Yes, there may be numbers which are divisible by p2, p3, … 
How many numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, ….. n} are divisible by p2, p3, …? 
There are ⌊n/(p2)⌋ numbers divisible by p2 (Every p2‘th number would be divisible). Similarly, there are ⌊n/(p3)⌋ numbers divisible by p3 and so on.
What is the largest possible value of x? 
So the largest possible power is ⌊n/p⌋ + ⌊n/(p2)⌋ + ⌊n/(p3)⌋ + …… 
Note that we add only ⌊n/(p2)⌋ only once (not twice) as one p is already considered by expression ⌊n/p⌋. Similarly, we consider ⌊n/(p3)⌋ (not thrice). 
Below is implementation of above idea. 
 

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find largest
# x such that p*x divides n!
 
# Returns largest power of p that divides n!
def largestPower(n, p):
     
    # Initialize result
    x = 0
 
    # Calculate x = n/p + n/(p^2) + n/(p^3) + ....
    while n:
        n /= p
        x += n
    return x
 
# Driver program
n = 10; p = 3
print ("The largest power of %d that divides %d! is %d\n"%
                                (p, n, largestPower(n, p)))

Output: 
 

The largest power of 3 that divides 10! is 4
Time complexity: O(logpn)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
What to do if p is not prime? 
We can find all prime factors of p and compute result for every prime factor. Refer Largest power of k in n! (factorial) where k may not be prime for details.
