A Krishnamurthy number is a number whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the number itself.
For example, 145 is the sum of the factorial of each digit.
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Examples: 

Input : 145
Output : YES
Explanation: 1! + 4! + 5! = 
1 + 24 + 120 = 145, which is equal to input,
hence YES.

Input : 235
Output : NO
Explanation: 2! + 3! + 5! = 
2 + 6 + 120 = 128, which is not equal to input, 
hence NO.

The idea is simple, we compute the sum of factorials of all digits and then compare the sum with n. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python program to check if a number
# is a krishnamurthy number
 
# function to calculate the factorial
# of any number
def factorial(n) :
    fact = 1
    while (n != 0) :
        fact = fact * n
        n = n - 1
    return fact
 
# function to Check if number is
# krishnamurthy/special
def isKrishnamurthy(n) :
    sum = 0
    temp = n
    while (temp != 0) :
 
        # calculate factorial of last digit
        # of temp and add it to sum
        rem = temp%10
        sum = sum + factorial(rem)
 
        # replace value of temp by temp / 10
        temp = temp // 10
         
    # Check if number is krishnamurthy
    return (sum == n)
 
# Driver code
n = 145
if (isKrishnamurthy(n)) :
    print("YES")
else :
    print("NO")

Output
YES
Time Complexity: O(n log10n) where n is a given number
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Interestingly, there are exactly four Krishnamurthy numbers i.e. 1, 2, 145, and 40585 known to us.
