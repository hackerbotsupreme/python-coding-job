Given a large number, the task is to check whether the number is divisible by 12 or not.

Examples : 

Input : 12244824607284961224
Output : Yes

Input : 92387493287593874594898678979792
Output : No
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1: This is a very simple approach. if a number is divisible by 4 and 3 then the number is divisible by 12. 

Point 1. If the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4 then the number is divisible by 4. Please see divisibility by 4 for large numbers for details. 
Point 2. if the sum of all digits of a number is divided by 3 then the number is divisible by 3. Please see divisibility by 3 for large numbers for details.
