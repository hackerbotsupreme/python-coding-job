Given an array of numbers, find GCD of the array elements. In a previous post we find GCD of two number.

Examples:

Input  : arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output : 1

Input  : arr[] = {2, 4, 6, 8}
Output : 2

The GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers, but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers. 

gcd(a, b, c) = gcd(a, gcd(b, c)) 
             = gcd(gcd(a, b), c) 
             = gcd(gcd(a, c), b)
For an array of elements, we do the following. We will also check for the result if the result at any step becomes 1 we will just return the 1 as gcd(1,x)=1. 

result = arr[0]
For i = 1 to n-1
   result = GCD(result, arr[i])
Below is the implementation of the above idea.

C++
Java
Python
# GCD of more than two (or array) numbers
  
# Function implements the Euclidean 
# algorithm to find H.C.F. of two number
def find_gcd(x, y):
      
    while(y):
        x, y = y, x % y
      
    return x
          
# Driver Code        
l = [2, 4, 6, 8, 16]
  
num1 = l[0]
num2 = l[1]
gcd = find_gcd(num1, num2)
  
for i in range(2, len(l)):
    gcd = find_gcd(gcd, l[i])
      
print(gcd)

import math
  
# Recursive Implementation
def GcdOfArray(arr, idx):
    if idx == len(arr)-1:
        return arr[idx]
        
    a = arr[idx]
    b = GcdOfArray(arr,idx+1)
      
    return math.gcd(a, b)
  
# Driver Code 
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print(GcdOfArray(arr,0))
  
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(GcdOfArray(arr,0))
