Given a number, the task is to find if the number is divisible by 9 or not. The input number may be large and it may not be possible to store even if we use long long int.

Examples: 

Input  : n = 69354
Output : Yes

Input  : n = 234567876799333
Output : No

Input  : n = 3635883959606670431112222
Output : No
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Since input number may be very large, we cannot use n % 9 to check if a number is divisible by 9 or not, especially in languages like C/C++. The idea is based on following fact. 

A number is divisible by 9 if sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
Illustration:  

For example n = 9432
Sum of digits = 9 + 4 + 3 + 2
             = 18
Since sum is divisible by 9,
answer is Yes.
How does this work?  

Let us consider 1332, we can write it as
1332 = 1*1000 + 3*100 + 3*10 + 2

The proof is based on below observation:
Remainder of 10i divided by 9 is 1
So powers of 10 only results in remainder 1 
when divided by 9.

Remainder of "1*1000 + 3*100 + 3*10 + 2"
divided by 9 can be written as : 
1*1 + 3*1 + 3*1 + 2 = 9
The above expression is basically sum of
all digits.

Since 9 is divisible by 9, answer is yes.
Below is the implementation of above idea.

C++
Java
Python3
# Python 3 program to
# find if a number is
# divisible by
# 9 or not
 
# Function to find that
# number divisible by 9
# or not
def check(st) :
 
    # Compute sum of digits
    n = len(st)
    digitSum = 0
     
    for i in range(0,n) :
        digitSum = digitSum + (int)(st[i])
 
    # Check if sum of digits
    # is divisible by 9.
    return (digitSum % 9 == 0)
 
# Driver code
st = "99333"
 
if(check(st)) :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("No")

Output


Yes
Time Complexity: O(logN), as we are traversing the digits which will effectively costs logN time.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), as we are not using any extra space. 

Method 2: Checking given number is divisible by 9 or not by using the modulo division operator “%”.  

C++
Java
Python3
# Python code
# To check whether the given number is divisible by 9 or not
 
#input
n=3635883959606670431112222
# the above input can also be given as n=input() -> taking input from user
# finding given number is divisible by 9 or not
if int(n)%9==0:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
