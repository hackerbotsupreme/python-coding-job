Given a very large number. Check its divisibility by 15.

Examples: 

Input: 31
Output: No

Input : num = "156457463274623847239840239
               402394085458848462385346236
               482374823647643742374523747
               264723762374620"
Output: Yes
Given number is divisible by 15
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
A number is divisible by 15 if it is divisible by 5 (if the last digit is 5 or 0), and it is divisible by 3 (if sum of digits is divisible by 3).
Here, used accumulate function to sum up all the numbers. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to check if
# a large number is
# divisible by 15
 
# to find sum
def accumulate(s):
    acc = 0;
    for i in range(len(s)):
        acc += ord(s[i]) - 48;
    return acc;
 
# function to check
# if a large number
# is divisible by 15
def isDivisible(s):
    # length of string
    n = len(s);
 
    # check divisibility by 5
    if (s[n - 1] != '5' and s[n - 1] != '0'):
        return False;
 
    # Sum of digits
    sum = accumulate(s);
     
    # if divisible by 3
    return (sum % 3 == 0);
 
 
# Driver Code
s = "15645746327462384723984023940239";
if isDivisible(s):
    print("Yes");
else:
    print("No");
 
s = "15645746327462384723984023940235";
if isDivisible(s):
    print("Yes");
else:
    print("No");

Output
No
Yes
Time complexity: O(number of digits) 
Auxiliary space: O(1)

Method 2: Checking given number is divisible by 15 or not by using the modulo division operator “%”. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python code
# To check whether the given number is divisible by 15 or not
 
#input
n=31
# the above input can also be given as n=input() -> taking input from user
# finding given number is divisible by 15 or not
if int(n)%15==0:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")

Output


No
Time complexity: O(1) as it is doing constant operations
Auxiliary Space: O(1) as it is using constant space for variables
