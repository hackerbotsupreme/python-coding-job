Given a number, the task is to check if a number is divisible by 6 or not. The input number may be large and it may not be possible to store even if we use long long int.

Examples: 

Input  : n = 2112
Output: Yes

Input : n = 1124
Output : No

Input  : n = 363588395960667043875487
Output : No
C++
Java
Python3
# Python code
# To check whether the given number is divisible by 6 or not
 
#input
n=363588395960667043875487
# the above input can also be given as n=input() -> taking input from user
# finding given number is divisible by 6 or not
if int(n)%6==0:
  print("Yes")
else:
  print("No")
C#
Javascript
PHP
Output
No
Time complexity: O(1) as it is performing constant operations
Auxiliary Space: O(1) as it is using constant space for variables

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Since input number may be very large, we cannot use n % 6 to check if a number is divisible by 6 or not, especially in languages like C/C++. The idea is based on following fact. 

A number is divisible by 6 it's divisible by 2 and 3. 
a)  A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is divisible by 2.
b)  A number is divisible by 3 if sum of digits is divisible by 3.
Below is the implementation based on above steps. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python 3 program to find
# if a number is divisible
# by 6 or not
 
# Function to find that number
# is divisible by 6 or not
def check(st) :
    n = len(st)
     
     
    # Return false if number
    # is not divisible by 2.
    if (((int)(st[n-1])%2) != 0) :
        return False
  
    # If we reach here, number
    # is divisible by 2. Now
    # check for 3.
  
    # Compute sum of digits
    digitSum = 0
    for i in range(0, n) :
        digitSum = digitSum + (int)(st[i])
  
    # Check if sum of digits
    # is divisible by 3
    return (digitSum % 3 == 0)
 
 
# Driver code
st = "1332"
if(check(st)) :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("No ")

Output
Yes
Time Complexity: O(logN) where N is the given number
Auxiliary Space: O(1) since no extra space is being used
