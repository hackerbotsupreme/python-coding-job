A quick solution to check if a number is divisible by 29 or not is to add 3 times of last digit to rest number and repeat this process until number comes 2 digit. The given number is divisible by 29 if the obtained two digit number is divisible by 29.
Number is 348, 
Three times of last digit + Rest of the number = 8*3 + 34 = 58
Since 58 is divisible by 29, 348 is also divisible by 29.

# Python3 program to demonstrate above
# method to check divisibility by 29.
 
# Returns true if n is divisible
# by 29 else returns false.
def isDivisible(n):
 
    # add the lastdigit*3 to renaming
    # number until number comes only
    # 2 digit
    while (int(n / 100)) :
        last_digit = int(n % 10)
        n = int(n / 10)
        n += last_digit * 3
     
    # return true if number is
    # divisible by 29 another
    return (n % 29 == 0)
 
# Driver Code
n = 348
 
if(isDivisible(n) != 0):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
