#in python programming we give commands based  on a particular desicion this kind of cases are called is conditional expression.
#some of them are elif , if else, for, else.... like
a=34
if(a>3):
    print("the value of a is greater than 3")
elif(a<3):
    print("the value of a is lesser than 7 ")
else:
    print ("the value is not greater than 3 and 7 ")#so when the given condition meets true then the program terminates 


b=78
if(a>4):
    print ("the value of b  is  greater than 3")
elif(a>13):
    print("the value of b is greater than 13")
elif(a>7):
    print("the value of b is greater than 7")
elif(a>36):
    print("the value of a is greater than 36")
else :
    print("the value is not greater than 3 and 7")
#what you see above is if-else ladder from which only one line of code will get printed, and the very would have meet true to our given condition    
#one more thing that if any of the elif conditions doesnot meets true then the else statement will get printed .
#the  extra space under if statement is called indentation .
