#Program for subtraction of matrices

#Difficulty Level : Basic

#The below program subtracts of two square matrices of size 4*4, we can change N for a different dimension. 

#Implementation:

#C++
#C
#Java
#Python3
# Python 3 program for subtraction
# of matrices
 
N = 4
 
# This function returns 1
# if A[][] and B[][] are identical
# otherwise returns 0
def subtract(A, B, C):
     
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            C[i][j] = A[i][j] - B[i][j]
 
# Driver Code
A = [ [1, 1, 1, 1],
      [2, 2, 2, 2],
      [3, 3, 3, 3],
      [4, 4, 4, 4]]
 
B = [ [1, 1, 1, 1],
      [2, 2, 2, 2],
      [3, 3, 3, 3],
      [4, 4, 4, 4]]
                     
C = A[:][:] # To store result
     
subtract(A, B, C)
 
print("Result matrix is")
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        print(C[i][j], " ", end = '')
    print()

#Output
#Result matrix is 
#0 0 0 0 
#0 0 0 0 
#0 0 0 0 
#0 0 0 0 
#Note â€“ The number at 0th row and 0th column of first matrix gets subtracted with number at 0th row and 0th column of second matrix. And its subtraction result gets initialized as the value of 0th row and 0th column of resultant matrix. Same subtraction process applied for all the elements

#The program can be extended for rectangular matrices. The following post can be useful for extending this program.
