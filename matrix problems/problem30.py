#Find all permuted rows of a given row in a matrix

#Difficulty Level : Easy
#We are given an m*n matrix of positive integers and a row number. The task is to find all rows in given matrix which are permutations of given row elements. It is also given that values in every row are distinct.

#Examples:  

#Input : mat[][] = {{3, 1, 4, 2}, 
#                   {1, 6, 9, 3},
#                   {1, 2, 3, 4},
#                   {4, 3, 2, 1}}
#        row = 3    
#Output: 0, 2
#Rows at indexes 0 and 2 are permutations of
#row at index 3. 
#Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
#A simple solution is to one by one sort all rows and check all rows. If any row is completely equal to the given row, that means the current row is a permutation of the given row. The time complexity for this approach will be O(m*n log n).

#An efficient approach is to use hashing. Simply create a hash set for the given row. After hash set creation, traverse through the remaining rows, and for every row check if all of its elements are present in the hash set or not.  

#Implementation:


# Python program to find all
# permutations of a given row
 
# Function to find all
# permuted rows of a given row r
def permutatedRows(mat, m, n, r):
 
 
    # Creating an empty set
    s=set()
 
    # Count frequencies of
    # elements in given row r
    for j in range(n):
        s.add(mat[r][j])   
 
    # Traverse through all remaining rows
    for i in range(m):
 
        # we do not need to check
        # for given row r
        if i == r:
            continue
 
        # initialize hash i.e
        # count frequencies
        # of elements in row i
        for j in range(n):
            if mat[i][j] not in s:
 
                # to avoid the case when last
                # element does not match
                j = j - 2
                break;
        if j + 1 != n:
            continue
        print(i)
             
     
 
# Driver program to run the case
m = 4
n = 4
r = 3
mat = [[3, 1, 4, 2],
       [1, 6, 9, 3],
       [1, 2, 3, 4],
       [4, 3, 2, 1]]
 
permutatedRows(mat, m, n, r)

#Output
#0, 2, 
#Time complexity: O(m*n) 
#Auxiliary space: O(n)



#Another approach to the solution is using the Standard Template Library(STL):  


# Python3 program to find all permutations of a given row
MAX = 100
 
# This function checks if two arrays are permutations of each other
def is_permutation(a, b):
    return sorted(a) == sorted(b)
     
# Function to find all permuted rows of a given row r
def permutatedRows(mat, m, n, r):
     
    for i in range(min(m, r)):
        if is_permutation(mat[i], mat[r]):
            print(i, end = ", ")
 
# Driver program to run the case
m = 4
n = 4
r = 3;
mat =  [[ 3, 1, 4, 2], [1, 6, 9, 3], [1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]];
             
permutatedRows(mat, m, n, r);

#Output
#0,2,
#Time Complexity: O(m*n), where m is the number of rows and n is the size of each row. We need to compare each row with the given row, so the time complexity is O(m*n).
#Auxiliary Space : O(1). No extra space is used.

#Exercise : 
#Extend the above solution to work for an input matrix where all elements of a row donâ€™t have to be distinct. (Hit: We can use Hash Map instead of a Hash Set)
