#Given two matrices, the task is to multiply them. Matrices can either be square or rectangular:

#Examples: 

#(Square Matrix Multiplication)#

#Input: mat1[m][n] = { {1, 1}, {2, 2} }
#mat2[n][p] = { {1, 1}, {2, 2} }
#Output: result[m][p] = { {3, 3}, {6, 6} }#

#(Rectangular Matrix Multiplication)#

#Input: mat1[3][2] = { {1, 1}, {2, 2}, {3,# 3} }
#mat2[2][3] = { {1, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 2} }
#Output: result[3][3] = { {3, 3, 3}, {6, 6, 6}, {9, 9, 9} }

##Multiplication of two Square or Rectangular Matrices:
#The number of columns in Matrix-1 must be equal to the number of rows in Matrix-2.
#Output of multiplication of Matrix-1 and Matrix-2, results with equal to the number of rows of Matrix-1 and  the number of columns of Matrix-2 i.e. rslt[R1][C2]
