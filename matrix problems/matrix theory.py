#Matrix Data Structure
#What is Matrix Data Structure?

#A matrix represents a collection of numbers arranged in an order of rows and columns. It is necessary to enclose the elements of a matrix in parentheses or brackets.
#For example:

#A matrix with 9 elements is shown below.

#This Matrix [M] has 3 rows and 3 columns. Each element of matrix [M] can be referred to by its row and column number. For example, a23 = 6.
