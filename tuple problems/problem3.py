#write a  python program for adding
# tuple to list and vice-vesa




#Sometimes, while working with Python containers,
# we can have a problem in which we need to perform 
# addition of one container with another. This kind of problem can have occurrence in many data domains across Computer Science and Programming. Letâ€™s discuss certain ways in which this task can be performed.
#Method 1 : Using += operator [list + tuple] 
#This operator can be used to join a list with a tuple. 
# Internally its working is similar to that of list.extend(), which can have any iterable as its argument, tuple in this case.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of
# Adding Tuple to List and vice - versa
# Using += operator (list + tuple)
 
# initializing list
test_list = [5, 6, 7]
 
# printing original list
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
 
# initializing tuple
test_tup = (9, 10)
 
# Adding Tuple to List and vice - versa
# Using += operator (list + tuple)
test_list += test_tup
 
# printing result
print("The container after addition : " + str(test_list))




#Method #2 : Using tuple(), data type conversion [tuple + list] 
#he following technique is used to add list to a tuple. The tuple 
#has to converted to list and list has to be added, at last resultant 
# is converted to tuple.

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of
# Adding Tuple to List and vice - versa
# Using tuple(), data type conversion [tuple + list]
 
# initializing list
test_list = [5, 6, 7]
 
# printing original list
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
 
# initializing tuple
test_tup = (9, 10)
 
# Adding Tuple to List and vice - versa
# Using tuple(), data type conversion [tuple + list]
res = tuple(list(test_tup) + test_list)
 
# printing result
print("The container after addition : " + str(res))





#Method #3: Using tuple(),list() and extend() methods

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of
# Adding Tuple to List and vice - versa
 
# initializing list and tuple
test_list = [5, 6, 7]
test_tup = (9,10)
 
# printing original list
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
 
# Adding Tuple to List
test_list.extend(list(test_tup))
# printing result
print("The container after addition : " + str(test_list))
 
#*********************************************************
 
# initializing list and tuple
test_list = [1,2,3,4]
test_tup=(5,6)
 
# printing original tuple
print("The original tuple is : " + str(test_tup))
 
#Adding list to tuple
test_tup=list(test_tup)
test_tup.extend(test_list)
test_tup=tuple(test_tup)
# printing result
print("The container after addition : " + str(test_tup))
