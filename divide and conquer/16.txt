Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s. Find the number of 0s. Count the number of zeroes in the given array.
Examples : 

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0}
Output: 2

Input: arr[] = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Output: 4

Input: arr[] = {0, 0, 0}
Output: 3

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 0

Approach 1: A simple solution is to traverse the input array. As soon as we find a 0, we return n – index of first 0. Here n is number of elements in input array. Time complexity of this solution would be O(n).

Implementation of above approach is below:

C++
Java
Python3
class GFG :
    @staticmethod
    def  firstzeroindex( arr,  n) :
        i = 0
        while (i < n) :
            if (arr[i] == 0) :
                return i
            i += 1
        return -1
    @staticmethod
    def main( args) :
        arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        n = len(arr)
        x = GFG.firstzeroindex(arr, n)
        if (x == -1) :
            print("Count of zero is 0")
        else :
            print("count of zero is ", end ="")
            print(n - x)
     
 
if __name__=="__main__":
    GFG.main([])

Output
count of zero is 6
Time complexity: O(n) where n is size of arr.

Approach 2: Since the input array is sorted, we can use Binary Search to find the first occurrence of 0. Once we have index of first element, we can return count as n – index of first zero.

Implementation:



C
C++
Java
Python3
# A divide and conquer solution to
# find count of zeroes in an array
# where all 1s are present before all 0s
 
# if 0 is present in arr[] then returns
# the index of FIRST occurrence of 0 in
# arr[low..high], otherwise returns -1
def firstZero(arr, low, high):
 
    if (high >= low):
     
        # Check if mid element is first 0
        mid = low + int((high - low) / 2)
        if (( mid == 0 or arr[mid-1] == 1)
                      and arr[mid] == 0):
            return mid
         
        # If mid element is not 0
        if (arr[mid] == 1):
            return firstZero(arr, (mid + 1), high)
             
        # If mid element is 0, but not first 0
        else:
            return firstZero(arr, low, (mid - 1))
     
    return -1
 
# A wrapper over recursive
# function firstZero()
def countZeroes(arr, n):
 
    # Find index of first zero in given array
    first = firstZero(arr, 0, n - 1)
 
    # If 0 is not present at all, return 0
    if (first == -1):
        return 0
 
    return (n - first)
 
# Driver Code
arr = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
n = len(arr)
print("Count of zeroes is",
        countZeroes(arr, n))

Output
Count of zeroes is 5
Time Complexity: O(Logn) where n is number of elements in arr[].

Auxiliary Space: O(logn)
