Consider a n x n grid with indexes of top left corner as (0, 0). Dyck path is a staircase walk from bottom left, i.e., (n-1, 0) to top right, i.e., (0, n-1) that lies above the diagonal cells (or cells on line from bottom left to top right).
The task is to count the number of Dyck Paths from (n-1, 0) to (0, n-1).
Examples : 

Input : n = 1
Output : 1

Input : n = 2
Output : 2

Input : n = 3
Output : 5

Input : n = 4
Output : 14
 

dyckpaths

The number of Dyck paths from (n-1, 0) to (0, n-1) can be given by the Catalan numberC(n).
C_n=\frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n1}=\prod_{k=2}^{n}\frac{n+k}{k} \ for\ n\geq 0  
 

We strongly recommend that you click here and practice it, before moving on to the solution.
Below are the implementations to find count of Dyck Paths (or n’th Catalan number).
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to count
# number of Dyck Paths
 
# Returns count Dyck
# paths in n x n grid
def countDyckPaths(n):
     
    # Compute value of 2nCn
    res = 1
    for i in range(0, n):
        res *= (2 * n - i)
        res /= (i + 1)
 
    # return 2nCn/(n+1)
    return res / (n+1)
 
# Driver Code
n = 4
print("Number of Dyck Paths is ",
    str(int(countDyckPaths(n))))

Find number of sequences of 1 and -1 such that every sequence follows below constraints : 
a) The length of a sequence is 2n 
b) There are equal number of 1’s and -1’s, i.e., n 1’s, n -1s 
c) Sum of prefix of every sequence is greater than or equal to 0. For example, 1, -1, 1, -1 and 1, 1, -1, -1 are valid, but -1, -1, 1, 1 is not valid.
Number of paths of length m + n from (m-1, 0) to (0, n-1) that are restricted to east and north steps.
