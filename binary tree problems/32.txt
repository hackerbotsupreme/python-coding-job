Given two Binary Trees, write a function that returns true if two trees are mirror of each other, else false. For example, the function should return true for following input trees.

This problem is different from the problem discussed here.
For two trees ‘a’ and ‘b’ to be mirror images, the following three conditions must be true: 

Their root node’s key must be same
Left subtree of root of ‘a’ and right subtree root of ‘b’ are mirror.
Right subtree of ‘a’ and left subtree of ‘b’ are mirror.
Below is implementation of above idea. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to check if two
# trees are mirror of each other
 
# A binary tree node
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
 
# Given two trees, return true
# if they are mirror of each other
def areMirror(a, b):
     
    # Base case : Both empty
    if a is None and b is None:
        return True
     
    # If only one is empty
    if a is None or b is None:
        return False
     
    # Both non-empty, compare them
    # recursively. Note that in
    # recursive calls, we pass left
    # of one tree and right of other tree
    return (a.data == b.data and
            areMirror(a.left, b.right) and
            areMirror(a.right , b.left))
 
# Driver code
root1 = Node(1)
root2 = Node(1)
 
root1.left = Node(2)
root1.right = Node(3)
root1.left.left = Node(4)
root1.left.right = Node(5)
 
root2.left = Node(3)
root2.right = Node(2)
root2.right.left = Node(5)
root2.right.right = Node(4)
 
if areMirror(root1, root2):
    print ("Yes")
else:
    print ("No")
