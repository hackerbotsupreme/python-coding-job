Given a string that contains ternary expressions. The expressions may be nested, task is convert the given ternary expression to a binary Tree. 

Examples: 

Input :  string expression =   a?b:c 
Output :        a
              /  \
             b    c

Input : expression =  a?b?c:d:e
Output :     a
           /  \
          b    e
        /  \
       c    d

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Idea is that we traverse a string make first character as root and do following step recursively . 

If we see Symbol ‘?’ 
then we add next character as the left child of root. 
If we see Symbol ‘:’ 
then we add it as the right child of current root. 
do this process until we traverse all element of “String”. 

Below is the implementation of above idea  

C++
Java
Python3
# Class to define a node 
# structure of the tree
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.data = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
  
# Function to convert ternary 
# expression to a Binary tree
# It returns the root node 
# of the tree
def convert_expression(expression, i):
    if i >= len(expression):
        return None
  
    # Create a new node object
    # for the expression at
    # ith index
    root = Node(expression[i])
  
    i += 1
  
    # if current character of 
    # ternary expression is '?'
    # then we add next character 
    # as a left child of
    # current node
    if (i < len(expression) and 
                expression[i] is "?"):
        root.left = convert_expression(expression, i + 1)
          
    # else we have to add it 
    # as a right child of
    # current node expression[0] == ':'
    elif i < len(expression):
        root.right = convert_expression(expression, i + 1)
    return root
  
# Function to print the tree
# in a pre-order traversal pattern
def print_tree(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.data, end=' ')
    print_tree(root.left)
    print_tree(root.right)
  
# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    string_expression = "a?b?c:d:e"
    root_node = convert_expression(string_expression, 0)
    print_tree(root_node)
