Complete the function to find spiral order traversal of a tree. For below tree, function should return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.


 
 

Example 1:

Input:
      1
    /   \

Your Task:
The task is to complete the function findSpiral() which takes root node as input parameter and returns the elements in spiral form of level order traversal as a list. The newline is automatically appended by the driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
0 <= Number of nodes <= 105
0 <= Data of a node <= 105
