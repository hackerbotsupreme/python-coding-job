Given a Binary Tree where each node has the following structure, write a function to populate the next pointer for all nodes. The next pointer for every node should be set to point to in-order successor.

C++
C
Java
Python3
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.next = None

Initially, all next pointers have NULL values. Your function should fill these next pointers so that they point to inorder successor.

Solution (Use Reverse Inorder Traversal) 
Traverse the given tree in reverse inorder traversal and keep track of previously visited node. When a node is being visited, assign a previously visited node as next.

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to populate
# inorder traversal of all nodes
 
# Tree node
 
 
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.next = None
 
 
# The first visited node will be
# the rightmost node next of the
# rightmost node will be None
next = None
 
# Set next of p and all descendants of p
# by traversing them in reverse Inorder
 
 
def populateNext(p):
 
    global next
 
    if (p != None):
 
        # First set the next pointer
        # in right subtree
        populateNext(p.right)
 
        # Set the next as previously visited node
        # in reverse Inorder
        p.next = next
 
        # Change the prev for subsequent node
        next = p
 
        # Finally, set the next pointer
        # in left subtree
        populateNext(p.left)
 
# UTILITY FUNCTIONS
# Helper function that allocates
# a new node with the given data
# and None left and right pointers.
 
 
def newnode(data):
 
    node = Node(0)
    node.data = data
    node.left = None
    node.right = None
    node.next = None
 
    return(node)
 
# Driver Code
 
 
# Constructed binary tree is
#         10
#     / \
#     8     12
# /
# 3
root = newnode(10)
root.left = newnode(8)
root.right = newnode(12)
root.left.left = newnode(3)
 
# Populates nextRight pointer
# in all nodes
p = populateNext(root)
 
# Let us see the populated values
ptr = root.left.left
while(ptr != None):
 
    out = 0
    if(ptr.next != None):
        out = ptr.next.data
    else:
        out = -1
 
    # -1 is printed if there is no successor
    print("Next of", ptr.data, "is", out)
    ptr = ptr.next

Output
Next of 3 is 8
Next of 8 is 10
Next of 10 is 12
Next of 12 is -1
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
