Consider a binary tree whose nodes have ids from 1 to n where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is given as a collection of n pairs, where every pair represents node id and the sum of children ids.

Examples: 

Input : 1 5
        2 0
        3 0
        4 0
        5 5
        6 5
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, two trees can 
be made as follows and 6 is the root node.
   6          6
   \         / \
    5       1   4
   / \       \
  1   4       5
 / \         / \
2   3       2   3

Input : 4 0
Output: 4
Explanation: Clearly 4 does 
not have any children and is the
only node i.e., the root node.
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
At first sight, this question appears to be a typical question of a tree data structure but it 
can be solved as follows.

Every node id appears in children sum except root. So if we do the sum of all ids and subtract it from the sum of all childrenâ€™s sums, we get the root.

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
"""Find root of tree where children
sum for every node id is given"""
 
def findRoot(arr, n) :
 
    # Every node appears once as an id, and
    # every node except for the root appears
    # once in a sum. So if we subtract all
    # the sums from all the ids, we're left
    # with the root id.
    root = 0
    for i in range(n):
        root += (arr[i][0] - arr[i][1])
    return root
                         
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
 
    arr = [[1, 5], [2, 0],
           [3, 0], [4, 0],
           [5, 5], [6, 5]]
    n = len(arr)
    print(findRoot(arr, n))

Output
6
Time Complexity: O(n), Where n is the length of the given array.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), As no extra space is used.
