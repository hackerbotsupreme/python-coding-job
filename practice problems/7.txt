Given two numbers N and A, find N-th root of A. In mathematics, Nth root of a number A is a real number that gives A, when we raise it to integer power N. These roots are used in Number Theory and other advanced branches of mathematics. 
Refer Wiki page for more information. 
Examples: 
 

Input : A = 81
        N = 4
Output : 3 
3^4 = 81

As this problem involves a real valued function A^(1/N) we can solve this using Newton’s method, which starts with an initial guess and iteratively shift towards the result. 
We can derive a relation between two consecutive values of iteration using Newton’s method as follows, 
 

according to newton’s method
x(K+1) = x(K) – f(x) / f’(x)        
here    f(x)  = x^(N) – A
so    f’(x) = N*x^(N - 1)
and     x(K) denoted the value of x at Kth iteration
putting the values and simplifying we get,
x(K + 1) = (1 / N) * ((N - 1) * x(K) + A / x(K) ^ (N - 1))
Using above relation, we can solve the given problem. In below code we iterate over values of x, until difference between two consecutive values of x become lower than desired accuracy.
Below is the implementation of above approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to calculate
# Nth root of a number
import math
import random
 
# method returns Nth power of A
def nthRoot(A,N):
 
    # initially guessing a random number between
    # 0 and 9
    xPre = random.randint(1,101) % 10
  
    #  smaller eps, denotes more accuracy
    eps = 0.001
  
    # initializing difference between two
    # roots by INT_MAX
    delX = 2147483647
  
    #  xK denotes current value of x
    xK=0.0
  
    #  loop until we reach desired accuracy
    while (delX > eps):
 
        # calculating current value from previous
        # value by newton's method
        xK = ((N - 1.0) * xPre +
              A/pow(xPre, N-1)) /N
        delX = abs(xK - xPre)
        xPre = xK;
         
    return xK
 
# Driver code
N = 4
A = 81
nthRootValue = nthRoot(A, N)
 
print("Nth root is ", nthRootValue)
 
## Acalc = pow(nthRootValue, N);
## print("Error in difference of powers ",
##             abs(A - Acalc))
