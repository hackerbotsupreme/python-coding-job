You are given a function foo() that represents a biased coin. When foo() is called, it returns 0 with 60% probability, and 1 with 40% probability. Write a new function that returns 0 and 1 with a 50% probability each. Your function should use only foo(), no other library method.

Solution: 
We know foo() returns 0 with 60% probability. How can we ensure that 0 and 1 are returned with a 50% probability? 
The solution is similar to this post. If we can somehow get two cases with equal probability, then we are done. We call foo() two times. Both calls will return 0 with a 60% probability. So the two pairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) will be generated with equal probability from two calls of foo(). Let us see how.
(0, 1): The probability to get 0 followed by 1 from two calls of foo() = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 
(1, 0): The probability to get 1 followed by 0 from two calls of foo() = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24
So the two cases appear with equal probability. The idea is to return consider only the above two cases, return 0 in one case, return 1 in other case. For other cases [(0, 0) and (1, 1)], recur until you end up in any of the above two cases. 

The below program depicts how we can use foo() to return 0 and 1 with equal probability.

Python3
# Python3 program for the
# above approach
def foo():
   
    # Some code here
    pass
 
# Returns both 0 and 1
# with 50% probability
def my_fun():
   
    val1, val2 = foo(), foo()
     
    if val1 ^ val2:
       
        # Will reach here with
        # (0.24 + 0.24) probability
        return val1
       
    # Will reach here with
    # (1 - 0.24 - 0.24) probability
    return my_fun()
 
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(my_fun())
