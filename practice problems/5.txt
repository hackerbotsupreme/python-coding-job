For a given number find the square root using log function. Number may be int, float or double.

Examples: 

Input  : n = 9
Output : 3

Input  : n = 2.93
Output : 1.711724

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We can find square root of a number using sqrt() method:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to demonstrate finding
# square root of a number using sqrt()
import math
 
if __name__=='__main__':
    n = 12
    print(math.sqrt(n))
 
# This code is contributed by
# Sanjit_Prasad
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output
3.464102 
Time complexity: O(log2n), for using sqrt() function.
Auxiliary space: O(1)



We can also find square root using log2() library function: 

C++
Java
Python
# Python program to demonstrate finding
# square root of a number using sqrt()
import math
 
# function to return squareroot
def squareRoot(n):
 
    return pow(2, 0.5 * math.log2(n))
 
# Driver program
 
n = 12
print(squareRoot(n))
 
# This code is contributed by
# Sanjit_Prasad
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output
3.464102 
Time complexity: O(log2log2N), complexity of using log(N) is log(logN), and pow(x,N) is log(N), so pow(2,0.5*log(n)) will be log(logN).
Auxiliary space: O(1)

How does the above program work? 

 let d be our answer for input number n
 then n(1/2) = d 
     apply log2 on both sides
      log2(n(1/2)) = log2(d)
      log2(d) = 1/2 * log2(n)
      d = 2(1/2 * log2(n)) 
      d = pow(2, 0.5*log2(n))
