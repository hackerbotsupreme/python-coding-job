Given a polynomial function f(x) = 1+ a1*x + a2*(x^2) + … an(x^n). Find the Sgn value of these function, when x is given and all the coefficients also. 
 

If value of polynomial greater than 0
   Sign = 1
Else If value of polynomial less than 0
   Sign = -1
Else if value of polynomial is 0
   Sign = 0
Examples: 
 

Input: poly[] = [1, 2, 3] 
       x = 1 
Output:  1 
Explanation: f(1) = 6 which is > 0 
hence 1.

Input: poly[] = [1, -1, 2, 3] 
       x = -2 
Output: -1 
Explanation: f(-2)=-11 which is less 
than 0, hence -1.
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
A naive approach will be to calculate every power of x and then add it to the answer by multiplying it with its coefficient. Calculating power of x will take O(n) time and for n coefficients. Hence, taking the total complexity to O(n * n), as we will need nested loops for traversing n*n times.
An efficient approach is to use Horner’s method. We evaluate value of polynomial using Horner’s method. Then we return value according to sign of the value. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach 
 


C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find
# sign value of a
# polynomial
 
# returns value of poly[0]x(n-1) +
# poly[1]x(n-2) + .. + poly[n-1]
def horner( poly, n, x):
     
    # Initialize result
    result = poly[0];
     
    # Evaluate value of
    # polynomial using
    # Horner's method
    for i in range(1,n):
        result = (result * x +
                     poly[i]);
    return result;
 
# Returns sign value
# of polynomial
def findSign(poly, n, x):
    result = horner(poly, n, x);
    if (result > 0):
        return 1;
    elif (result < 0):
        return -1;
    return 0;
 
# Driver Code
 
# Let us evaluate value
# of 2x3 - 6x2
# + 2x - 1 for x = 3
poly = [2, -6, 2, -1];
x = 3;
n = len(poly);
 
print("Sign of polynomial is ",
         findSign(poly, n, x));

Javascript
Output: 

Sign of polynomial is 1
Time Complexity: O(N), as we are using a loop to traverse N times.

Auxiliary Space: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.
