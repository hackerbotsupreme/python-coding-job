Given two numbers, first calculate arithmetic mean and geometric mean of these two numbers. Using the arithmetic mean and geometric mean so calculated, find the harmonic mean between the two numbers.

Examples: 

Input : a = 2
        b = 4
Output : 2.666

Input : a = 5
        b = 15
Output : 7.500
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Arithmetic Mean: Arithmetic Mean ‘AM’ between two numbers a and b is such a number that AM-a = b-AM. Thus, if we are given these two numbers, the arithmetic mean AM = 1/2(a+b)
Geometric Mean: Geometric Mean ‘GM’ between two numbers a and b is such a number that GM/a = b/GM. Thus, if we are given these two numbers, the geometric mean GM = sqrt(a*b)
Harmonic Mean: Harmonic Mean ‘HM’ between two numbers a and b is such a number that 1/HM – 1/a = 1/b – 1/HM. Thus, if we are given these two numbers, the harmonic mean HM = 2ab/a+b
Now, we also know that GM^2 = AM * HM

# Python 3 implementation of computation
# of arithmetic mean, geometric mean
# and harmonic mean
 
import math
 
# Function to calculate arithmetic
# mean, geometric mean and harmonic mean
def compute( a, b) :
    AM = (a + b) / 2
    GM = math.sqrt(a * b)
    HM = (GM * GM) / AM
    return HM
 
# Driver function
a = 5
b = 15
HM = compute(a, b)
print("Harmonic Mean between " , a,
      " and ", b , " is " , HM )

Output: 

Harmonic Mean between 5 and 15 is 7.500
Time Complexity: O(log(a*b)), for using sqrt function where a and b represents the given integers. 
Auxiliary Space: O(1), no extra space is required, so it is a constant.
