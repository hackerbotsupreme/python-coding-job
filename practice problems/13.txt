Given two positive numbers x and y, check if y is a power of x or not.
Examples : 

Input:  x = 10, y = 1
Output: True
x^0 = 1

Input:  x = 10, y = 1000
Output: True
x^3 = 1

Input:  x = 10, y = 1001
Output: False

A simple solution is to repeatedly compute the powers of x. If a power becomes equal to y, then y is a power, else not.

# python program to check
# if a number is power of
# another number
 
# Returns true if y is a
# power of x
def isPower (x, y):
     
    # The only power of 1
    # is 1 itself
    if (x == 1):
        return (y == 1)
         
    # Repeatedly compute
    # power of x
    pow = 1
    while (pow < y):
        pow = pow * x
 
    # Check if power of x
    # becomes y
    return (pow == y)
     
     
# Driver Code
# check the result for
# true/false and print.
if(isPower(10, 1)):
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
 
if(isPower(1, 20)):
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
if(isPower(2, 128)):
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)
if(isPower(2, 30)):
    print(1)
else:
    print(0)

Optimization: 
We can optimize above solution to work in O(Log Log y). The idea is to do squaring of power instead of multiplying it with x, i.e., compare y with x^2, x^4, x^8, â€¦etc. If x becomes equal to y, return true. If x becomes more than y, then we do binary search for power of x between previous power and current power, i.e., between x^i and x^(i/2).
Following are detailed step. 

1) Initialize pow = x, i = 1
2) while (pow < y)
   {
      pow = pow*pow 
      i *= 2
   }    
3) If pow == y
     return true;
4) Else construct an array of powers
   from x^i to x^(i/2)
5) Binary Search for y in array constructed
   in step 4. If not found, return false. 
   Else return true.
Alternate Solution : 
The idea is to take log of y in base x. If it turns out to be an integer, we return true. Else false. 

C++
// CPP program to check given number y
// is power of x
#include <iostream>
#include <math.h>
using namespace std;
 
bool isPower(int x, int y)
{
    // logarithm function to calculate value
    double res1 = log(y) / log(x);
    double res2 = log(y) / log(x); // Note : this is double
 
    // compare to the result1 or result2 both are equal
    return (res1 == res2);
}
 
// Driven program
int main()
{
    cout << isPower(2, 128) << endl;
    return 0;
}
