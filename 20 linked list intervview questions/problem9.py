#Delete last occurrence of an item from linked list
#Difficulty Level : Easy
#Using pointers, loop through the whole list and keep track of the node prior to the node containing the last occurrence key using a special pointer. After this just store the next of next of the special pointer, into to next of special pointer to remove the required node from the linked list.

#Given a linked list and a key to be deleted. Delete last occurrence of key from linked. The list may have duplicates.

#Examples:  

#Input:   1->2->3->5->2->10, key = 2
#Output:  1->2->3->5->10
#Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
#The idea is to traverse the linked list from beginning to end. While traversing, keep track of last occurrence key. After traversing the complete list, delete the last occurrence by copying data of next node and deleting the next node.
