Given some resources in the form of linked list you have to canceled out all the resources whose sum up to 0(Zero) and return the remaining list.

E.g-->> 6 -6 8 4 -12 9 8 -8

the above example lists which gets canceled :
6 -6
8 4 -12
8 -8
o/p : 9
case 3 : 4 6 -10 8 9 10 -19 10 -18 20 25
O/P : 20 25
