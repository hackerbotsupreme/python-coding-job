Given a Number N in String form, Print 1 If the digits of the number are in non-decreasing or non-increasing order, else print 0.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = "1233"
Output:
1
Explanation:
The digits of the number are in non-
decreasing order. So, the Output is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = "1263"
Output:
0
Explanation:
The digits of the number are neither in
non-decreasing nor in non-increasing order.
So, the Output is 0.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function difProblem() which takes a String N as input and returns 0 or 1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= |N| <= 105
