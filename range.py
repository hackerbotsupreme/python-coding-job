#a range function in python is used to generate a sequence of numbers.
#in  range we can also specify start , stop , and skip size. 
#as follows  range(start , stop, skip-size)
#the syntax is ---  for i in range(start , stop, skip-size)
for i in  range(10):
    print(i)
else:
    print("this is inside else of for")
#the result is it prints from 1 to 9(given range 10 ) (as i said it used to generate sequence of charecters)and prints the else statement
