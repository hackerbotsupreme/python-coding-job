Given a positive integer n such that n > 2. Divide numbers from 1 to n in two groups such that absolute difference of sum of each group is minimum. Print any two groups with their size in first line and in next line print elements of that group.
Examples: 
 

Input : 5
Output : 2
         5 2
         3
         4 3 1
Here sum of group 1 is 7 and sum of group 2 is 8.
Their absolute difference is 1 which is minimum.
We can have multiple correct answers. (1, 2, 5) and 
(3, 4) is another such group.

Input : 6
Output : 2
         6 4
         4
         5 3 2 1
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We can always divide sum of n integers in two groups such that their absolute difference of their sum is 0 or 1. So sum of group at most differ by 1. We define sum of group1 as half of n elements sum.
Now run a loop from n to 1 and insert i into group1 if inserting an element doesnâ€™t exceed group1 sum otherwise insert that i into group2.

    group2=[]
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
 
        # If sum is greater then or equal
        # to 0 include i in group 1
        # otherwise include in group2
        if (group1Sum - i >= 0) :
            group1.append(i)
 
            # Decrease sum of group1
            group1Sum -= i
         
        else :
            group2.append(i)
 
    # Print both the groups
    printVector(group1)
    printVector(group2)
