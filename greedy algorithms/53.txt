Given an amount, find the minimum number of notes of different denominations that sum up to the given amount. Starting from the highest denomination note, try to accommodate as many notes as possible for a given amount.
We may assume that we have infinite supply of notes of values {2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1} 
Examples: 
 

Input : 800
Output : Currency  Count 
         500 : 1
         200 : 1
         100 : 1

Input : 2456
Output : Currency  Count
         2000 : 1
         200 : 2
         50 : 1
         5 : 1
         1 : 1
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
This problem is a simple variation of coin change problem. Here Greedy approach works as the given system is canonical (Please refer this and this for details)
Below is the program implementation to find the number of notes: 
 

C++
Python3
# Python3 program to accept an amount
# and count number of notes
 
# Function to count and print
# currency notes
def countCurrency(amount):   
    notes = [2000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1]
    notesCount = {}
     
    for note in notes:
        if amount >= note:
            notesCount[note] = amount//note
            amount = amount % note
             
    print ("Currency Count ->")
    for key, val in notesCount.items():
        print(f"{key} : {val}")
 
# Driver code
amount = 868
countCurrency(amount)

Output: 
 

Currency  Count ->
500 : 1
200 : 1
100 : 1
50 : 1
10 : 1
5 : 1
1 : 3
