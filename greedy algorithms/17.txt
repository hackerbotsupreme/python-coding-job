Find the minimum sum of Products of two arrays of the same size, given that k modifications are allowed on the first array. In each modification, one array element of the first array can either be increased or decreased by 2.
Examples: 

Input : a[] = {1, 2, -3}
        b[]  = {-2, 3, -5}
           k = 5
Output : -31
Explanation:
Here n = 3 and k = 5. 
So, we modified a[2], which is -3 and 
increased it by 10 (as 5 modifications 
are allowed).
Final sum will be :
(1 * -2) + (2 * 3) + (7 * -5)
   -2    +    6    -    35
             -31
(which is the minimum sum of the array 
with given conditions)

Input : a[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 4}
        b[] = {3, 4, 2, 3, 2}
        k = 3
Output : 25
Explanation: 
Here, total numbers are 5 and total 
modifications allowed are 3. So, modify 
a[1], which is 3 and decreased it by 6 
(as 3 modifications are allowed).
Final sum will be :
(2 * 3) + (-3 * 4) + (4 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (4 * 2)
   6    â€“    12    +    8    +    15   +    8
                        25
(which is the minimum sum of the array with 
given conditions)
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Since we need to minimize the product sum, we find the maximum product and reduce it. By taking some examples, we observe that making 2*k changes to only one element is enough to get the minimum sum. Based on this observation, we consider every element as the element on which we apply all k operations and keep track of the element that reduces result to minimum.

        # Check if current difference
        # becomes higher
        # than the maximum difference so far.
        d = abs(pro - temp)
