Given an array of n integers. We need to reduce size of array to one. We are allowed to select a pair of integers and remove the larger one of these two. This decreases the array size by 1. Cost of this operation is equal to value of smaller one. Find out minimum sum of costs of operations needed to convert the array into a single element.

Examples: 

Input: 4 3 2 
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Choose (4, 2) so 4 is removed, new array 
= {2, 3}. Now choose (2, 3) so 3 is removed. 
So total cost = 2 + 2 = 4

Input: 3 4
Output: 3
Explanation: choose 3, 4, so cost is 3. 
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to always pick minimum value as part of the pair and remove larger value. This minimizes cost of reducing array to size 1.

Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

CPP
Java
Python3
# Python program to find minimum
# cost to reduce array size to 1
 
# function to calculate the
# minimum cost
def cost(a, n):
 
    # Minimum cost is n-1 multiplied
    # with minimum element.
    return ( (n - 1) * min(a) )
 
 
# driver code
a = [ 4, 3, 2 ]
n = len(a)
print(cost(a, n))

Output
4
Time Complexity: O(N), as we are using a min function which will cost O(N).
Auxiliary Space: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.
