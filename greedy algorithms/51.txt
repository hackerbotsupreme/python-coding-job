You are given a list of N coins of different denominations. You can pay an amount equivalent to any 1 coin and can acquire that coin. In addition, once you have paid for a coin, we can choose at most K more coins and can acquire those for free. The task is to find the minimum amount required to acquire all the N coins for a given value of K.

Examples : 

Input : coin[] = {100, 20, 50, 10, 2, 5}, 
        k = 3
Output : 7

Input : coin[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50}, 
        k = 3
Output : 3
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
As per the question, we can see that at a cost of 1 coin, we can acquire at most K+1 coins. Therefore, in order to acquire all the n coins, we will be choosing ceil(n/(k+1)) coins and the cost of choosing coins will be minimum if we choose the smallest ceil(n/(k+1)) ( Greedy approach). The smallest ceil(n/(k+1)) coins can be found by simply sorting all the N values in increasing order. 
If we should check for time complexity (n log n) is for sorting element and (k) is for adding the total amount. So, finally Time Complexity: O(n log n).

Python3
# Python3 program to
# acquire all n coins
 
import math
 
# function to calculate min cost
def minCost(coin, n, k):
 
    # sort the coins value
    coin.sort()
 
    # calculate no. of
    # coins needed
    coins_needed = math.ceil(1.0 * n //
                            (k + 1));
 
    # calculate sum of all
    # selected coins
    ans = 0
    for i in range(coins_needed - 1 + 1):
        ans += coin[i]
     
    return ans
 
# Driver code
coin = [8, 5, 3, 10,
        2, 1, 15, 25]
n = len(coin)
k = 3
 
print(minCost(coin, n, k))

Note that there are more efficient approaches to find the given number of smallest values. For example, method 6 of m largest(or smallest) elements in an array can find mâ€™th smallest element in (n-m) Log m + m Log m).

How to handle multiple queries for a single predefined array? 
In this case, if you are asked to find the above answer for many values of K, you have to compute it fast and our time complexity got increased as per the number of queries for k. For the purpose to serve, we can maintain a prefix sum array after sorting all the N values and can answer queries easily and quickly. 
Suppose 



C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to acquire all n coins at
# minimum cost with multiple values of k.
import math as mt
 
# Converts coin[] to prefix sum array
def preprocess(coin, n):
 
    # sort the coins values
    coin.sort()
     
    # maintain prefix sum array
    for i in range(1, n):
        coin[i] += coin[i - 1]
     
# Function to calculate min cost when we can 
# get k extra coins after paying cost of one.
def minCost(coin, n, k):
     
    # calculate no. of coins needed
    coins_needed = mt.ceil(1.0 * n / (k + 1))
     
    # return sum of from prefix array
    return coin[coins_needed - 1]
     
# Driver code
coin = [8, 5, 3, 10, 2, 1, 15, 25]
 
n = len(coin)
 
preprocess(coin, n)
k = 3
 
print(minCost(coin, n, k))
 
k = 7
 
print(minCost(coin, n, k))

After preprocessing, every query for a k takes O(1) time.
