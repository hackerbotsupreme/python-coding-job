In number system, Sylvester’s sequence is an integer sequence in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members, plus one. Given a positive integer N. The task is to print the first N member of the sequence. 
Since numbers can be very big, use %10^9 + 7.
Examples: 
 

Input : N = 6
Output : 2 3 7 43 1807 3263443

Input : N = 2
Output : 2 3
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to run a loop and take two variables and initialise them as 1 and 2, one to store the product till now and other to store the current number which is nothing but the first number + 1 and for each step multiply both using arithmetic modular operation i.e (a + b)%N = (a%N + b%N)%N where N is a modular number.
Below is the implementation of this approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python
# Python Code for Sylvester sequence
 
def printSequence(n) :
    a = 1 # To store the product.
    ans = 2 # To store the current number.
    N = 1000000007
     
    # Loop till n.
    i = 1
    while i <= n :
        print ans,
        ans = ((a % N) * (ans % N)) % N
        a = ans
        ans = (ans + 1) % N
        i = i + 1
         
 
# Driver program to test above function
n = 6
