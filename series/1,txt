Juggler Sequence is a series of integer number in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation : 
a_{k+1}=\begin{Bmatrix} \lfloor a_{k}^{1/2} \rfloor & for \quad even \quad a_k\\ \lfloor a_{k}^{3/2} \rfloor & for \quad odd \quad a_k \end{Bmatrix}       
Juggler Sequence starting with number 3: 
5, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
Juggler Sequence starting with number 9: 
9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
Given a number n we have to print the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence. 
Examples: 
 

Input: 9
Output: 9, 27, 140, 11, 36, 6, 2, 1
We start with 9 and use above formula to get
next terms.

Input: 6
Output: 6, 2, 1

Time complexity: O(nlogn) since using a single while loop and finding square root takes logarithmic time.

Space complexity: O(1) for constant variables

Important Points: 

The terms in Juggler Sequence first increase to a peak value and then start decreasing.
The last term in Juggler Sequence is always 1.
