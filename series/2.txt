Padovan Sequence similar to Fibonacci sequence with similar recursive structure. The recursive formula is, 
 

  P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
  P(0) = P(1) = P(2) = 1 
Fibonacci Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55…… 
Spiral of squares with side lengths which follow the Fibonacci sequence.

Padovan Sequence: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 28, 37,….. 
Spiral of equilateral triangles with side lengths which follow the Padovan sequence.

Examples: 
 

For Padovan Sequence:
P0 = P1 = P2 = 1 ,
P(7) = P(5) + P(4)
     = P(3) + P(2) + P(2) + P(1)
     = P(2) + P(1) + 1 + 1 + 1
     = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 
     = 5
