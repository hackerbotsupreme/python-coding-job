Newman-Conway Sequence is the one that generates the following integer sequence. 
1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5 6 7 7…

In mathematical terms, the sequence P(n) of Newman-Conway numbers is defined by the recurrence relation 

P(n) = P(P(n - 1)) + P(n - P(n - 1)) 
with seed values P(1) = 1 and P(2) = 1

Given a number n, print n-th number in Newman-Conway Sequence.

Examples:

Input : n = 2
Output : 1

Input : n = 10
Output : 6
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution. 
 
Method 1 (Use Recursion) : 

A simple approach is direct recursive implementation of above recurrence relation.  

C++
Java
Python
# Recursive function to find the n-th
# element of sequence
def sequence(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return sequence(sequence(n-1)) + sequence(n-sequence(n-1));
         
# Driver code
def main():
    n = 10
    print sequence(n)
     
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output : 

6
Time complexity: O(n)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method 2 (Use Dynamic Programming): 

We can avoid repeated work done in method 1 by storing the values in the sequence in an array. 

C++
Java
Python
''' Python program to find the n-th element of
    Newman-Conway Sequence'''
 
# To declare array import module array
import array
def sequence(n):
    f = array.array('i', [0, 1, 1])
 
    # To store values of sequence in array
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        r = f[f[i-1]]+f[i-f[i-1]]
        f.append(r);
 
    return r
 
# Driver code
def main():
    n = 10
    print sequence(n)
     
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output : 

6
Time complexity: O(n) 

Auxiliary Space: O(n)
