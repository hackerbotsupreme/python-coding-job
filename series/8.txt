Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
A simple solution is to compute terms one by one and add to the result.
The above problem can be efficiently solved using the following formula:
 


 

 

C++14
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find
# sum of series
# 2, 22, 222, ..
import math
 
# function which return
# the sum of series
def sumOfSeries( n ):
    return 0.02469 * ((10*math.pow(10, n) - 1 )- (9 * n))
     
# driver code
n = 3
print( sumOfSeries(n))
