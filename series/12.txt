Given a series 2, 12, 36, 80, 150.. Find the n-th term of the series.
Examples : 
 

Input : 2
Output : 12

Input : 4
Output : 80 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
If we take a closer look, we can notice that series is sum of squares and cubes of natural numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …..) + (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ….).
Therefore n-th number of the series is n^2 + n^3

Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find n-th term of
# the series 2, 12, 36, 80, 150, ..
 
# Returns n-th term of the series
# 2, 12, 36, 80, 150
def nthTerm( n ):
    return (n * n) + (n * n * n)
 
# driver code
n = 4
print( nthTerm(n))
