Hardy Ramanujam theorem states that the number of prime factors of n will approximately be log(log(n)) for most natural numbers n
Examples : 
 

5192 has 2 distinct prime factors and log(log(5192)) = 2.1615 
51242183 has 3 distinct prime facts and log(log(51242183)) = 2.8765

As the statement quotes, it is only an approximation. There are counter examples such as 
 

510510 has 7 distinct prime factors but log(log(510510)) = 2.5759 
1048576 has 1 prime factor but log(log(1048576)) = 2.62922

This theorem is mainly used in approximation algorithms and its proof lead to bigger concepts in probability theory.

        while (n % 2 == 0) :
            n = int(n / 2)
 
    # n must be odd at this
    # point. So we can skip
    # one element (Note i = i +2)
    i = 3
     
    while (i <= int(math.sqrt(n))) :
        if (n % i == 0) :    
            count = count + 1
            while (n % i == 0) :
                n = int(n / i)
        i = i + 2
 
    # This condition is to
    # handle the case when n
    # is a prime number greater
