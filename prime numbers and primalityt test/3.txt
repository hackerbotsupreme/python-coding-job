Mersenne Prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. In other words, any prime is Mersenne Prime if it is of the form 2k-1 where k is an integer greater than or equal to 2. First few Mersenne Primes are 3, 7, 31 and 127.
The task is print all Mersenne Primes smaller than an input positive integer n.
Examples: 
 

Input: 10
Output: 3 7
3 and 7 are prime numbers smaller than or
equal to 10 and are of the form 2k-1

Input: 100
Output: 3 7 31

The idea is to generate all the primes less than or equal to the given number n using Sieve of Eratosthenes. Once we have generated all such primes, we iterate through all numbers of the form 2k-1 and check if they are primes or not.
Below is the implementation of the idea.
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Program to generate mersenne primes
 
# Generate all prime numbers
# less than n.
def SieveOfEratosthenes(n, prime):
 
    # Initialize all entries of boolean
    # array as true. A value in prime[i]
    # will finally be false if i is Not
    # a prime, else true bool prime[n+1]
    for i in range(0, n + 1) :
        prime[i] = True
 
    p = 2
    while(p * p <= n):
     
        # If prime[p] is not changed,
        # then it is a prime
        if (prime[p] == True) :
         
            # Update all multiples of p
            for i in range(p * 2, n + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
                 
        p += 1
         
# Function to generate mersenne
# primes less than or equal to n
def mersennePrimes(n) :
 
    # Create a boolean array
    # "prime[0..n]"
    prime = [0] * (n + 1)
 
    # Generating primes using Sieve
    SieveOfEratosthenes(n, prime)
 
    # Generate all numbers of the
    # form 2^k - 1 and smaller
    # than or equal to n.
    k = 2
    while(((1 << k) - 1) <= n ):
     
        num = (1 << k) - 1
 
        # Checking whether number
        # is prime and is one
        # less than the power of 2
        if (prime[num]) :
            print(num, end = " " )
             
        k += 1
     
# Driver Code
n = 31
print("Mersenne prime numbers smaller",
              "than or equal to " , n )
mersennePrimes(n)
