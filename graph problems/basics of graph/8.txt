Transpose of a directed graph G is another directed graph on the same set of vertices with all of the edges reversed compared to the orientation of the corresponding edges in G. That is, if G contains an edge (u, v) then the converse/transpose/reverse of G contains an edge (v, u) and vice versa. Given a graph (represented as adjacency list), we need to find another graph which is the transpose of the given graph. 

Example:

Transpose graph
Transpose Graph

Input : figure (i) is the input graph.
Output : figure (ii) is the transpose graph of the given graph.
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We traverse the adjacency list and as we find a vertex v in the adjacency list of vertex u which indicates an edge from u to v in main graph, we just add an edge from v to u in the transpose graph i.e. add u in the adjacency list of vertex v of the new graph. Thus traversing lists of all vertices of main graph we can get the transpose graph. Thus the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(V+E) where V is number of vertices of graph and E is the number of edges of the graph. Note : It is simple to get the transpose of a graph which is stored in adjacency matrix format, you just need to get the transpose of that matrix. 

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find transpose of a graph.
 
# function to add an edge from vertex
# source to vertex dest
def addEdge(adj, src, dest):
    adj[src].append(dest)
 
# function to print adjacency list
# of a graph
def displayGraph(adj, v):
    for i in range(v):
        print(i, "--> ", end = "")
        for j in range(len(adj[i])):
            print(adj[i][j], end = " ")
        print()
 
# function to get Transpose of a graph
# taking adjacency list of given graph
# and that of Transpose graph
def transposeGraph(adj, transpose, v):
     
    # traverse the adjacency list of given
    # graph and for each edge (u, v) add
    # an edge (v, u) in the transpose graph's
    # adjacency list
    for i in range(v):
        for j in range(len(adj[i])):
            addEdge(transpose, adj[i][j], i)
 
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
 
    v = 5
    adj = [[] for i in range(v)]
    addEdge(adj, 0, 1)
    addEdge(adj, 0, 4)
    addEdge(adj, 0, 3)
    addEdge(adj, 2, 0)
    addEdge(adj, 3, 2)
    addEdge(adj, 4, 1)
    addEdge(adj, 4, 3)
 
    # Finding transpose of graph represented
    # by adjacency list adj[]
    transpose = [[]for i in range(v)]
    transposeGraph(adj, transpose, v)
 
    # displaying adjacency list of
    # transpose graph i.e. b
    displayGraph(transpose, v)
