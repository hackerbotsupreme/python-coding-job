Here the function takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k). 

Example: 

Input: n = 4 and k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 4 C 2 is 4!/(2!*2!) = 6
Input: n = 5 and k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: 5 C 2 is 5!/(3!*2!) = 10
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We have discussed O(n*k) time and O(k) extra space algorithm in this post. The value of C(n, k) can be calculated in O(k) time and O(1) extra space.

Approach:

Change r to n-r if r is greater than n-r. and create a variable to store the answer.
Run a loop from 0 to r-1
In every iteration update ans as (ans*(n-i))/(i+1) where i is the loop counter.
So the answer will be equal to ((n/1)*((n-1)/2)*â€¦*((n-r+1)/r) which is equal to nCr.
C(n, k) 
= n! / (n-k)! * k!
= [n * (n-1) *....* 1]  / [ ( (n-k) * (n-k-1) * .... * 1) * 
                            ( k * (k-1) * .... * 1 ) ]
After simplifying, we get
C(n, k) 
= [n * (n-1) * .... * (n-k+1)] / [k * (k-1) * .... * 1]

Also, C(n, k) = C(n, n-k)  
// r can be changed to n-r if r > n-r 
Following implementation uses the above formula to calculate C(n, k).

# Python program to calculate C(n, k)
 
# Returns value of Binomial Coefficient
# C(n, k)
def binomialCoefficient(n, k):
    # since C(n, k) = C(n, n - k)
    if(k > n - k):
        k = n - k
    # initialize result
    res = 1
    # Calculate value of
    # [n * (n-1) *---* (n-k + 1)] / [k * (k-1) *----* 1]
    for i in range(k):
        res = res * (n - i)
        res = res // (i + 1)
    return res
 
# Driver program to test above function
n = 8
k = 2
res = binomialCoefficient(n, k)
print("Value of C(% d, % d) is % d" %(n, k, res))

Output
Value of C(8, 2) is 28
Complexity Analysis: 



Time Complexity: O(r) A loop has to be run from 0 to r. So, the time complexity is O(r).

Auxiliary Space: O(1) As no extra space is required.
