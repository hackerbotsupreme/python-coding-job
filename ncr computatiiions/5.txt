Given a positive integer n. The task is to find the sum of square of Binomial Coefficient i.e 
nC02 + nC12 + nC22 + nC32 + ……… + nCn-22 + nCn-12 + nCn2 
Examples: 
 

Input : n = 4
Output : 70

Input : n = 5
Output : 252
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1: (Brute Force) 
The idea is to generate all the terms of binomial coefficient and find the sum of square of each binomial coefficient.
Below is the implementation of this approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python Program to find
# the sum of square of
# binomial coefficient.
 
# Return the sum of
# square of binomial
# coefficient
def sumofsquare(n) :
     
    C = [[0 for i in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n + 1)]
             
    # Calculate value of
    # Binomial Coefficient
    # in bottom up manner
    for i in range(0, n + 1) :
     
        for j in range(0, min(i, n) + 1) :
                     
            # Base Cases
            if (j == 0 or j == i) :
                C[i][j] = 1
 
            # Calculate value
            # using previously
            # stored values
            else :
                C[i][j] = (C[i - 1][j - 1] +
                           C[i - 1][j])
 
     
    # Finding the sum of
    # square of binomial
    # coefficient.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(0, n + 1) :
        sum = sum + (C[n][i] *
                     C[n][i])
     
    return sum

Method 2: (Using Formula) 
^nC^2_0 + ^nC^2_1 + ^nC^2_2 + .... + ^nC^2_n-1 + ^nC^2_n    
= ^2nC_n    
= \frac{(2n)!}{(n!)^2}    
Proof, 
 

We know,
(1 + x)n = nC0 + nC1 x + nC2 x2 + ......... + nCn-1 xn-1 + nCn-1 xn
Also,
(x + 1)n = nC0 xn + nC1 xn-1 + nC2 xn-2 + ......... + nCn-1 x + nCn

Multiplying above two equations,
(1 + x)2n = [nC0 + nC1 x + nC2 x2 + ......... + nCn-1 xn-1 + nCn-1 xn] X 
            [nC0 xn + nC1 xn-1 + nC2 xn-2 + ......... + nCn-1 x + nCn]

Equating coefficients of xn on both sides, we get
2nCn = nC02 + nC12 + nC22 + nC32 + ......... + nCn-22 + nCn-12 + nCn2

Hence, sum of the squares of coefficients = 2nCn = (2n)!/(n!)2.
Also, (2n)!/(n!)2 = (2n * (2n – 1) * (2n – 2) * ….. * (n+1))/(n * (n – 1) * (n – 2) *….. * 1).
Below is the implementation of this approach: 
 

C++
Java
Python
# Python 3 Program to find the sum of
# square of binomial coefficient.
 
# function to return product of number
# from start to end.
def factorial(start, end):
 
    res = 1
     
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        res *= i
         
    return res
 
# Return the sum of square of binomial
# coefficient
def sumofsquare(n):
 
    return int(factorial(n + 1, 2 * n)
                     /factorial(1, n))
 
# Driven Program
 
n = 4
print(sumofsquare(n))
