a=34#assignment operators
print(a)
a+=2#used to add 2 in a 
a+=23
print(a)
a-=12#used to substract 12 in the a
print(a)
a*=2#used to substract 2 in the a
print(a)
a/=2#used to substract 2 in the aone more thing to note is 
print(a)#the result of this code is 47.0 which is a floating point number
        #and which came by diving 94(int) and 2(int) so for the division we need to be careful
        #that whether the result is floating point num or an integer
        #thinking of it here i can definately say  computer takes 47 as 47.0 in 
        #case of division,47=47.0
