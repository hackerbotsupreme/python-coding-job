Write a tail recursive function for calculating the n-th Fibonacci number. 
Examples : 
 

Input : n = 4
Output : fib(4) = 3

Input : n = 9
Output : fib(9) = 34
Prerequisites : Tail Recursion, Fibonacci numbers
A recursive function is tail recursive when the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Writing a tail recursion is little tricky. To get the correct intuition, we first look at the iterative approach of calculating the n-th Fibonacci number. 
 

int fib(int n)
{
  int a = 0, b = 1, c, i;
  if (n == 0)
    return a;
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)
  {
     c = a + b;
     a = b;
     b = c;
  }
  return b;
}
Here there are three possibilities related to n :- 
 

n == 0
 

n == 1
 

n > 1
First two are trivial. We focus on discussion of the case when n > 1. 
In our iterative approach for n > 1, 
We start with 
 



a = 0
b = 1
For n-1 times we repeat following for ordered pair (a,b) 
Though we used c in actual iterative approach, but the main aim was as below :- 
 

(a, b) = (b, a+b)
We finally return b after n-1 iterations.
Hence we repeat the same thing this time with the recursive approach. We set the default values 
 

a = 0
b = 1
Here weâ€™ll recursively call the same function n-1 times and correspondingly change the values of a and b. 
Finally, return b.
If its case of n == 0 OR n == 1, we need not worry much!
Here is implementation of tail recursive fibonacci code. 
 

C++
Java
Python3
# A tail recursive function to
# calculate n th fibonacci number
def fib(n, a = 0, b = 1):
    if n == 0:
        return a
    if n == 1:
        return b
    return fib(n - 1, b, a + b);
 
# Driver Code
n = 9;
print("fib("+str(n)+") = "+str(fib(n)))
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output : 
 

fib(9) = 34
