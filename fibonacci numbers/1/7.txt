Given a number N, the task is to evaluate below expression. Expected time complexity is O(1).

 f(n-1)*f(n+1) - f(n)*f(n)
Where f(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number with n >= 1. First few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ………..i.e. (considering 0 as 0th Fibonacci number) Examples :

Input : n = 5
Output : -1
f(5-1=4) = 3
f(5+1=6) = 8
f(5)*f(5)= 5*5 = 25
f(4)*f(6)- f(5)*f(5)= 24-25= -1
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE ” first, before moving on to the solution.
Although the task is simple i.e. find n-1th, nth and (n+1)-th Fibonacci numbers. Evaluate the expression and display the result. But this can be done in O(1) time using Cassini’s Identity which states that:

           f(n-1)*f(n+1) - f(n*n) = (-1)^n 
So, we don’t need to calculate any Fibonacci term,the only thing is to check whether n is even or odd. How does above formula work? The formula is based on matrix representation of Fibonacci numbers. fibo

# Returns (-1)^n
def cassini(n):
 
   return -1 if (n & 1) else 1
  
# Driver program
  
n = 5
print(cassini(n))

Output :

-1
Time complexity: O(1) since only constant operations are performed 



Auxiliary Space: O(1)
