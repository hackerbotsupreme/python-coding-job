#Find common elements in three sorted arrays

#Difficulty Level : Easy
#---------------------------------------------------------------
#Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays.

#Examples: 

#Input: 
#ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80} 
#ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100} 
#ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120} 
#Output: 20, 80

#Input: 
#ar1[] = {1, 5, 5} 
#ar2[] = {3, 4, 5, 5, 10} 
#ar3[] = {5, 5, 10, 20} 
#Output: 5, 5

#A simple solution is to first find intersection of two arrays and store the intersection in a temporary array, then find the intersection of third array and temporary array. 
#Time complexity of this solution is O(n1 + n2 + n3) where n1, n2 and n3 are sizes of ar1[], ar2[] and ar3[] respectively.
#The above solution requires extra space and two loops, we can find the common elements using a single loop and without extra space. The idea is similar to intersection of two arrays. Like two arrays loop, we run a loop and traverse three arrays. 
#Let the current element traversed in ar1[] be x, in ar2[] be y and in ar3[] be z. We can have following cases inside the loop. 

#If x, y and z are same, we can simply print any of them as common element and move ahead in all three arrays.
#Else If x < y, we can move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element.
#Else If x > z and y > z), we can simply move ahead in ar3[] as z cannot be a common element.

#common elements in three sorted arrays

# Python function to print common elements in three sorted arrays

#Output
#Common Elements are 20 80 
#Time complexity of the above solution is O(n1 + n2 + n3). In the worst case, the largest sized array may have all small elements and middle-sized array has all middle elements.
#Auxiliary Space:   O(1)
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Method 2:
#The approach used above works well if the arrays does not contain duplicate values however it can fail in cases where the array elements are repeated. This can lead to a single common element to get printed multiple times.

#These duplicate entries can be handled without using any additional data structure by keeping the track of the previous element. Since the elements inside the array are arranged in sorted manner there is no possibility for the repeated elements to occur at random positions. 

#Letâ€™s consider the current element traversed in ar1[] be x, in ar2[] be y and in ar3[] be z and let the variables prev1, prev2, prev3 for keeping the track of last encountered element in each array and initialize them with INT_MIN. Hence for every element we visit across each array, we check for the following. 

#If x = prev1, move ahead in ar1[] and repeat the procedure until x != prev1. Similarly, apply the same for the ar2[] and ar3[].
#If x, y, and z are same, we can simply print any of them as common element, update prev1, prev2, and prev3 and move ahead in all three arrays.
#Else If (x < y), we update prev1 and move ahead in ar1[] as x cannot be a common element.
#Else If (y < z), we update prev2 and move ahead in ar2[] as y cannot be a common element.
#Else If (x > z and y > z), we update prev3 and we move ahead in ar3[] as z cannot be a common element.

#Method 3:

For finding the frequency we can use a map but in this, we will use an array instead of a map. But the problem with using an array is, we cannot find the frequency of negative numbers so in the code given below we will consider each and every element of array to be positive.

#Method 4: Using STL
