#Find whether an array is subset of another array

#Difficulty Level : Easy
#-----------------------------------------------------------------
#Given two arrays: arr1[0..m-1] and arr2[0..n-1]. Find whether arr2[] is a subset of arr1[] or not. Both arrays are not in sorted order. It may be assumed that elements in both arrays are distinct.

#Examples: 

#Input: arr1[] = {11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7}, arr2[] = {11, 3, 7, 1} 
#Output: arr2[] is a subset of arr1[]

#Input: arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, arr2[] = {1, 2, 4} 
#Output: arr2[] is a subset of arr1[]

#Input: arr1[] = {10, 5, 2, 23, 19}, arr2[] = {19, 5, 3} 
#Output: arr2[] is not a subset of arr1[] 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

#Naive Approach to Find whether an array is subset of another array
#Use two loops: The outer loop picks all the elements of arr2[] one by one. The inner loop linearly searches for the element picked by the outer loop. If all elements are found then return 1, else return 0.

#Below is the implementation of the above approach:



# Python 3 program to find whether an array
# is subset of another array
 
# Return 1 if arr2[] is a subset of
# arr1[]
 
 
def isSubset(arr1, arr2, m, n):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if(arr2[i] == arr1[j]):
                break
 
        # If the above inner loop was
        # not broken at all then arr2[i]
        # is not present in arr1[]
        if (j == m):
            return 0
 
    # If we reach here then all

#Find whether an array is subset of another array using Sorting and Binary Search
#The idea is to sort the given array arr1[], and then for each element in arr2[] do a binary search for it in sorted arr1[]. If the element is not found then return 0. If all elements are present then return 1.

#Illustration:

#Given array arr1[] = { 11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7 } and arr2[] = { 11, 3, 7, 1 }.

#Step 1: We will sort the array arr1[], and have arr1[] = { 1, 3, 7, 11, 13, 21}.

#arr2[] = { 11, 3, 7, 1 }, 1 is present in arr1[] = { 1, 3, 7, 11, 13, 21}

#The algorithm is pretty straightforward.

#Look for the elements of arr2[] in sorted arr1[].
#If we encounter a particular value that is present in arr2[] but not in arr1[], the code will terminate, arr2[] can never be the subset of arr1[].

#Find whether an array is subset of another array using Sorting and Merging
#The idea is to sort the two arrays and then iterate on the second array looking for the same values on the first array using two pointers. Whenever we encounter the same values we will increment both the pointer and if we encounter any values less than that of the second array, we will increment the value of the pointer pointing to the first array. If the value is greater than that of the second array, we know the second array is not the subset of the first array.
