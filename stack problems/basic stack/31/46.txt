Given a string with brackets. If the start index of the open bracket is given, find the index of the closing bracket. Examples:

Input : string = [ABC[23]][89]
        index = 0
Output : 8
The opening bracket at index 0 corresponds
to closing bracket at index 8.

The idea is to use Stack data structure. We traverse given expression from given index and keep pushing starting brackets. Whenever we encounter a closing bracket, we pop a starting bracket. If stack becomes empty at any moment, we return that index. 

C++
Java
Python
# Python program to find index of closing
# bracket for a given opening bracket.
from collections import deque
 
def getIndex(s, i):
 
    # If input is invalid.
    if s[i] != '[':
        return -1
 
    # Create a deque to use it as a stack.
    d = deque()
 
    # Traverse through all elements
    # starting from i.
    for k in range(i, len(s)):
 
        # Pop a starting bracket
        # for every closing bracket
        if s[k] == ']':
            d.popleft()
 
        # Push all starting brackets
        elif s[k] == '[':
            d.append(s[i])
 
        # If deque becomes empty
        if not d:
            return k
 
    return -1
 
# Driver code to test above method.
def test(s, i):
    matching_index = getIndex(s, i)
    print(s + ", " + str(i) + ": " + str(matching_index))
 
def main():
    test("[ABC[23]][89]", 0) # should be 8
    test("[ABC[23]][89]", 4) # should be 7
    test("[ABC[23]][89]", 9) # should be 12
    test("[ABC[23]][89]", 1) # No matching bracket
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
C#
Javascript
Output:

[ABC[23]][89], 0: 8
[ABC[23]][89], 4: 7
[ABC[23]][89], 9: 12
[ABC[23]][89], 1: -1
Time Complexity: O(n) Auxiliary Space: O(n)
