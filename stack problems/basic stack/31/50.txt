Given a number , write a program to reverse this number using stack.

Examples: 

Input : 365
Output : 563

Input : 6899
Output : 9986
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We have already discussed the simple method to reverse a number in this post. In this post we will discuss about how to reverse a number using stack.
The idea to do this is to extract digits of the number and push the digits on to a stack. Once all of the digits of the number are pushed to the stack, we will start popping the contents of stack one by one and form a number. 
As stack is a LIFO data structure, digits of the newly formed number will be in reverse order.

Below is the implementation of above idea: 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to reverse the
# number using a stack
 
# Stack to maintain order of digits
st = [];
 
# Function to push digits into stack
def push_digits(number):
 
    while (number != 0):
        st.append(number % 10);
        number = int(number / 10);
 
# Function to reverse the number
def reverse_number(number):
     
    # Function call to push number's
    # digits to stack
    push_digits(number);
     
    reverse = 0;
    i = 1;
     
    # Popping the digits and forming
    # the reversed number
    while (len(st) > 0):
        reverse = reverse + (st[len(st) - 1] * i);
        st.pop();
        i = i * 10;
     
    # Return the reversed number formed
    return reverse;
 
# Driver Code
number = 39997;
 
# Function call to reverse number
print(reverse_number(number));

Output
79993
Time Complexity: O( logN ) 
Auxiliary Space: O( logN ), Where N is the input number.
