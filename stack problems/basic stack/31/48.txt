Given a sequence of n strings, the task is to check if any two similar words come together and then destroy each other then print the number of words left in the sequence after this pairwise destruction.

Examples: 

Input : ab aa aa bcd ab
Output : 3
As aa, aa destroys each other so, 
ab bcd ab is the new sequence.

Input :  tom jerry jerry tom
Output : 0

As first both jerry will destroy each other.
Then sequence will be tom, tom they will also destroy
each other. So, the final sequence doesnâ€™t contain any
word.

Method 1: 

1- Start traversing the sequence by storing it in vector.
  a) Check if the current string is equal to next string
     if yes, erase both from the vector.
  b) And check the same till last.
2- Return vector size.
Implementation:



C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to remove consecutive
# same words
 
# Function to find the size of
# manipulated sequence
def removeConsecutiveSame(v):
 
    n = len(v)
 
    # Start traversing the sequence
    i = 0
    while(i < n - 1):
         
        # Compare the current string with
        # next one Erase both if equal
        if ((i + 1) < len(v)) and (v[i] == v[i + 1]):
         
            # Erase function delete the element and
            # also shifts other element that's why
            # i is not updated
            v = v[:i]
            v = v[:i]
 
            # Update i, as to check from previous
            # element again
            if (i > 0):
                i -= 1
 
            # Reduce sequence size
            n = n - 2
         
        # Increment i, if not equal
        else:
            i += 1
     
    # Return modified size
    return len(v[:i - 1])
     
# Driver Code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    v = ["tom", "jerry", "jerry", "tom"]
    print(removeConsecutiveSame(v))

Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)

Method 2:(Using Stack) 

1- Start traversing the strings and push into stack.
    a) Check if the current string is same as the string
       at the top of the stack
        i) If yes, pop the string from top.
        ii) Else push the current string.
2- Return stack size if the whole sequence is traversed.
Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python implementation of above method
 
# Function to find the size of manipulated sequence
def removeConsecutiveSame(v):
    st = []
 
    # Start traversing the sequence
    for i in range(len(v)):
         
        # Push the current string if the stack
        # is empty
        if (len(st) == 0):
            st.append(v[i])
        else:
            Str = st[-1]
 
            # compare the current string with stack top
            # if equal, pop the top
            if (Str == v[i]):
                st.pop()
 
            # Otherwise push the current string
            else:
                st.append(v[i])
 
    # Return stack size
    return len(st)
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    V = [ "ab", "aa", "aa", "bcd", "ab"]
    print(removeConsecutiveSame(V))

Output
3
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the given sequence.
Auxiliary Space: O(N), since we are using a stack to store the elements of the sequence.
