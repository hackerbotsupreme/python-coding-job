Given a number and its base, convert it to decimal. The base of number can be anything such that all digits can be represented using 0 to 9 and A to Z. The value of A is 10, the value of B is 11 and so on. Write a function to convert the number to decimal.

Examples: 

Input number is given as string and output is an integer.

Input: str = "1100", base = 2 
Output: 12

Input: str = "11A", base = 16
Output: 282

Input: str = "123",  base = 8
Output: 83

We can always use the below formula to convert from any base to decimal.

"str" is input number as a string 
"base" is the base of the input number.

Decimal Equivalent is,
  1*str[len-1] + base*str[len-2] + (base)2*str[len-3] + ...
Below is implementation of above formula.  

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python program to convert a
# number from any base to decimal
 
# To return value of a char.
# For example, 2 is returned
# for '2'. 10 is returned for 'A',
# 11 for 'B'
def val(c):
    if c >= '0' and c <= '9':
        return ord(c) - ord('0')
    else:
        return ord(c) - ord('A') + 10;
 
# Function to convert a number
# from given base 'b' to decimal
def toDeci(str,base):
    llen = len(str)
    power = 1 #Initialize power of base
    num = 0     #Initialize result
 
    # Decimal equivalent is str[len-1]*1 +
    # str[len-2]*base + str[len-3]*(base^2) + ...
    for i in range(llen - 1, -1, -1):
         
        # A digit in input number must
        # be less than number's base
        if val(str[i]) >= base:
            print('Invalid Number')
            return -1
        num += val(str[i]) * power
        power = power * base
    return num
     
# Driver code
strr = "11A"
base = 16
print('Decimal equivalent of', strr,
              'in base', base, 'is',
                 toDeci(strr, base))

Output : 

Decimal equivalent of 11A in base 16 is 282
Time Complexity: O(N) n represents the length of string

Auxiliary Space: O(1)



How to do reverse? 

Let the given input decimal number be “inputNum” and target base be “base”. We repeatedly divide inputNum by base and store the remainder. We finally reverse the obtained string. Below is C implementation.

C++
C
Java
Python3
# Python3 Program to convert decimal to
# any given base
 
# To return char for a value. For example
# '2' is returned for 2. 'A' is returned
# for 10. 'B' for 11
def reVal(num):
 
    if (num >= 0 and num <= 9):
        return chr(num + ord('0'));
    else:
        return chr(num - 10 + ord('A'));
 
# Utility function to reverse a string
def strev(str):
 
    len = len(str);
    for i in range(int(len / 2)):
        temp = str[i];
        str[i] = str[len - i - 1];
        str[len - i - 1] = temp;
 
# Function to convert a given decimal
# number to a base 'base' and
def fromDeci(res, base, inputNum):
 
    index = 0; # Initialize index of result
 
    # Convert input number is given base
    # by repeatedly dividing it by base
    # and taking remainder
    while (inputNum > 0):
        res+= reVal(inputNum % base);
        inputNum = int(inputNum / base);
 
    # Reverse the result
    res = res[::-1];
 
    return res;
 
# Driver Code
inputNum = 282;
base = 16;
res = "";
print("Equivalent of", inputNum, "in base",
       base, "is", fromDeci(res, base, inputNum));

Output :

Equivalent of 282 in base 16 is  11A
Method: Using int function
Python3
n = "1100"
b = 2
print(int(n, b))
Output
12
Time complexity: O(N) Convert input number is given base by repeatedly inputNum dividing it by base and taking remainder takes O(n) complexity 

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
