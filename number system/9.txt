Find the binary equivalent of the given non-negative number n without using arithmetic operators.

Examples: 

Input : n = 10
Output : 1010

Input : n = 38
Output : 100110

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Note that + in below algorithm/program is used for concatenation purpose. 
Algorithm: 

decToBin(n)
    if n == 0
        return "0"
    Declare bin = ""
    Declare ch
    while n > 0
        if (n & 1) == 0
            ch = '0'
        else
            ch = '1'
        bin = ch + bin
        n = n >> 1
    return bin
 Below is the implementation of above approach:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 implementation of
# decimal to binary conversion
# without using arithmetic operators
 
# function for decimal to
# binary conversion without
# using arithmetic operators
def decToBin(n):
    if(n == 0):
        return "0";
         
    # to store the binary
    # equivalent of decimal
    bin = "";
     
    while (n > 0):
         
        # to get the last binary
        # digit of the number 'n'
        # and accumulate it at
        # the beginning of 'bin'
        if (n & 1 == 0):
            bin = '0' + bin;
        else:
            bin = '1' + bin;
         
        # right shift 'n' by 1
        # It also gives n//2 .
        n = n >> 1;
     
    # required binary number
    return bin;
 
# Driver Code
n = 38;
print(decToBin(n));

Output: 
 



100110
Time complexity: O(num), where num is the number of bits in the binary representation of n.
Auxiliary space: O(num), for using extra space for string bin.
