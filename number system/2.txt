Given a positive decimal number, find the simple exponential notation (x = aÂ·10^b) of the given number. Examples:

Input : 100.0
Output : 1E2
Explanation:
The exponential notation of 100.0 is 1E2.

Input :19
Output :1.9E1
Explanation:
The exponential notation of 16 is 1.6E1.
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: The simplest way is to find the position of the first non zero digit and the position of the dot. The difference between that positions is the value of b (if the value is positive you should also decrease it by one). Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 code to find the exponential notation
  
# function to calculate the exponential
# notation
def FindExponent(s, n):
    # Storing the result in an array
    res = []
    i = 0
    while (s[i] in '.0'):
        i += 1
     
    j = n - 1
    while (s[j] in '.0' ):
        j -= 1
         
    # Finding the first index in s which is equal to '.'
    if '.' in s:
        c = s.index('.')
    # if '.' not found then put c = n.
    else:
        c = n
 
    res.append(s[i]);
      
    if (i != j):
        res.append('.');
          
    for k in range(i + 1, 1 + j):
        if (s[k] != '.'):
            res.append(s[k]);
  
    if (i < c):
        b = c - i - 1;
     
    else:
        b = c - i;
     
      
    if (b != 0):
        res.append("E");
        res.append(str(b));
     
    print("".join(res))
 
# main function
s = "100";
n = len(s)
FindExponent(list(s), n);
 
# The code is contributed by phasing17

Output:

1E2
