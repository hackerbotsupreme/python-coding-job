This program checks whether a number n can be expressed as power of k and if yes, then to what power should k be raised to make it n. Following example will clarify : 
Examples: 
 

Input :   n = 16, k = 2 
Output :  yes : 4
Explanation : Answer is yes because 16 can 
be expressed as power of 2. 
                        
Input :   n = 27, k = 3 
Output :  yes : 3
Explanation : Answer is yes as 27 can be
expressed as power of 3.

Input :  n = 20, k = 5
Output : No
Explanation : Answer is No as 20 cannot 
be expressed as power of 5.  
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We have discussed two methods in below post 
:Check if a number is a power of another number
In this post, a new Base Changing method is discussed.
In Base Changing Method, we simply change the base of number n to k and check if the first digit of Changed number is 1 and remaining all are zero.
Example for this : Let’s take n = 16 and k = 2. 
Change 16 to base 2. i.e. (10000)2. Since first digit is 1 and remaining are zero. Hence 16 can be expressed as power of 2. Count the length of (10000)2 and subtract 1 from it, that’ll be the number to which 2 must be raised to make 16. In this case 5 – 1 = 4.
Another example : Let’s take n = 20 and k = 3. 
20 in base 3 is (202)3. Since there are two non-zero digit, hence 20 cannot be expressed as power of 3.

        # Find current digit in base k
        digit = n % k
  
        # If digit is neither 0 nor 1
        if (digit > 1):
            return False
  
        # Make sure that only one 1
        # is present.
        if (digit == 1):

            oneSeen = True
  
        n //= k
     
    return True
     
# Driver code
 
n = 64
k = 4
  
if (isPowerOfK(n , k)):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
