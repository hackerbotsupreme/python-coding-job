Given an array of size N. Let A and B be the minimum and maximum in the array respectively. Task is to find how many number should be added to the given array such that all the element in the range [A, B] occur at-least once in the array.
Examples: 
 

Input : arr[] = {4, 5, 3, 8, 6}
Output : 1
Only 7 to be added in the list.

Input : arr[] = {2, 1, 3}
Output : 0

Method 1 (Sorting):

Sort the array. 
Compare arr[i] == arr[i+1]-1 or not. If not, update count = arr[i+1]-arr[i]-1. 
Return count. 
Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# python program for above implementation
 
# Function to count numbers to be added
def countNum(arr, n):
     
    count = 0
 
    # Sort the array
    arr.sort()
 
    # Check if elements are consecutive
    # or not. If not, update count
    for i in range(0, n-1):
        if (arr[i] != arr[i+1] and
            arr[i] != arr[i + 1] - 1):
            count += arr[i + 1] - arr[i] - 1;
 
    return count
 
# Drivers code
arr = [ 3, 5, 8, 6 ]
n = len(arr)
print(countNum(arr, n))

Output
2
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method 2 (Use Hashing):

Maintain a hash of array elements. 
Store minimum and maximum element. 
Traverse from minimum to maximum element in hash 
And count if element is not in hash. 
Return count. 
Implementation:



C++
Java
Python3
# Function to count numbers to be added
def countNum(arr, n):
 
    s = dict()
    count, maxm, minm = 0, -10**9, 10**9
 
    # Make a hash of elements and store
    # minimum and maximum element
    for i in range(n):
        s[arr[i]] = 1
        if (arr[i] < minm):
            minm = arr[i]
        if (arr[i] > maxm):
            maxm = arr[i]
     
    # Traverse all elements from minimum
    # to maximum and count if it is not
    # in the hash
    for i in range(minm, maxm + 1):
        if i not in s.keys():
            count += 1
    return count
 
# Driver code
arr = [3, 5, 8, 6 ]
n = len(arr)
print(countNum(arr, n))
