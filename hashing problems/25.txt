Given an integer array, print k-th distinct element in an array. The given array may contain duplicates and the output should print k-th element among all unique elements. If k is more than number of distinct elements, print -1.
Examples : 

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2}, 
        k = 2
Output : 4

First non-repeating element is 3
Second non-repeating element is 4

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 50, 10, 20, 2}, 
        k = 3
Output : 10

Input : {2, 2, 2, 2}, 
        k = 2
Output : -1

A simple solution is to use two nested loops where outer loop picks elements from left to right, and inner loop checks if the picked element is present somewhere else. If not present, then increment count of distinct elements. If count becomes k, return current element.

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to print k-th distinct
# element in a given array
 
# Returns k-th distinct
# element in arr.
def printKDistinct(arr, n, k):
    dist_count = 0
    for i in range(n):
         
        # Check if current element is
        # present somewhere else.
        j = 0
        while j < n:
            if (i != j and arr[j] == arr[i]):
                break
            j += 1
 
        # If element is unique
        if (j == n):
            dist_count += 1
 
        if (dist_count == k):
            return arr[i]
 
    return -1
 
# Driver Code
ar = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2]
n = len(ar)
k = 2
print(printKDistinct(ar, n, k))

An efficient solution is to use Hashing to solve this in O(n) time on average. 

create an empty hash table. 
 Traverse input array from left to right and store elements and their counts in the hash table. 
Traverse input array again from left to right. Keep counting elements with count as 1. 
If count becomes k, return current element. 
Implementation:



C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to print k-th
# distinct element in a given array
def printKDistinct(arr, size, KthIndex):
    dict = {}
    vect = []
    for i in range(size):
        if(arr[i] in dict):
            dict[arr[i]] = dict[arr[i]] + 1
        else:
            dict[arr[i]] = 1
    for i in range(size):
        if(dict[arr[i]] > 1):
            continue
        else:
            KthIndex = KthIndex - 1
        if(KthIndex == 0):
            return arr[i]
    return -1

arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2]
size = len(arr)
print(printKDistinct(arr, size, 2))
