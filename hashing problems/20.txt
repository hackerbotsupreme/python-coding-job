Given two arrays A[] and B[] consisting of n and m elements respectively. Find the minimum number of elements to remove from each array such that no common element exist in both.

Examples: 

Input : A[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4}
        B[] = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 }
Output : 3
We need to remove 2, 3 and 4 from any array.

Input : A[] = { 4, 2, 4, 4}
        B[] = { 4, 3 }
Output : 1
We need to remove 4 from B[]

Input : A[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
        B[] = { 5, 6, 7 }
Output : 0
There is no common element in both.

Count occurrence of each number in both arrays. If there is a number in both array remove number from array in which it appears less number of times add it to the result. 

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find minimum
# element to remove so no common
# element exist in both array
 
# To find no elements to remove
# so no common element exist
def minRemove(a, b, n, m):
 
    # To store count of array element
    countA = dict()
    countB = dict()
 
    # Count elements of a
    for i in range(n):
        countA[a[i]] = countA.get(a[i], 0) + 1
 
    # Count elements of b
    for i in range(n):
        countB[b[i]] = countB.get(b[i], 0) + 1
 
    # Traverse through all common
    # element, and pick minimum
    # occurrence from two arrays
    res = 0
    for x in countA:
        if x in countB.keys():
            res += min(countA[x],countB[x])
 
    # To return count of
    # minimum elements
    return res
 
# Driver Code
a = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 8 ]
n = len(a)
m = len(b)
print(minRemove(a, b, n, m))
