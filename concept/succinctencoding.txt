Succinct Encoding of Binary Tree in C++
The n'th Catalan number is designated by the number of structurally different binary trees with n different nodes. If the n is large, this is about 4n; thus, we require minimum about log2(4) n = 2n bits to encode it. A succinct binary tree therefore would consume 2n + O(n) bits.
