Given an array of n integers and a number m, find the maximum possible difference between two sets of m elements chosen from given array.

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = 1 2 3 4 5
            m = 4
Output : 4
The maximum four elements are 2, 3, 
4 and 5. The minimum four elements are 
1, 2, 3 and 4. The difference between
two sums is (2 + 3 + 4 + 5) - (1 + 2
+ 3 + 4) = 4
  
Input : arr[] = 5 8 11 40 15
           m = 2
Output : 42
The difference is (40 + 15) - (5  + 8)           
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is to first sort the array, then find sum of first m elements and sum of last m elements. Finally return difference between two sums.

Implementation:

CPP
Java
Python3
# Python program to
# find difference
# between max and
# min sum of array
 
def find_difference(arr, n, m):
    max = 0; min = 0
      
    # sort array
    arr.sort();
    j = n-1
    for i in range(m):
        min += arr[i]
        max += arr[j]
        j = j - 1
      
    return (max - min)
  
# Driver code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    n = len(arr)
    m = 4
 
    print(find_difference(arr, n, m))

We can optimize the above solution using more efficient approaches discussed in below post.
