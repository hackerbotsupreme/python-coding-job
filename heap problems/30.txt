Given a stream of integers represented as arr[]. For each index i from 0 to n-1, print the multiplication of largest, second largest, third largest element of the subarray arr[0…i]. If i < 2 print -1. 

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output :-1
        -1
         6
         24
         60
Explanation : for i = 2 only three elements 
are there {1, 2, 3} so answer is 6. For i = 3
largest three elements are {2, 3, 4} their
product is 2*3*4 = 24 ....so on            
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
We will use priority queue here. 

Insert arr[i] in the priority queue
As the top element in priority queue is largest so pop it and store it as x. Now the top element in the priority queue will be the second largest element in subarray arr[0…i] pop it and store as y. Now the top element is third largest element in subarray arr[0…i] so pop it and store it as z.
Print x*y*z
Reinsert x, y, z.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:


C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 implementation of largest triplet
# multiplication
from queue import PriorityQueue
 
# Prints the product of three largest
# numbers in subarray arr[0..i]
def LargestTripletMultiplication(arr, n):
     
    # Call a priority queue
    q = PriorityQueue()
 
    # Traversing the array
    for i in range(n):
         
        # Pushing -arr[i] in array
        # to get max PriorityQueue
        q.put(-arr[i])
 
        # If less than three elements
        # are present in array print -1
        if (q.qsize() < 3):
            print(-1)
        else:
             
            # pop three largest elements
            x = q.get()
            y = q.get()
            z = q.get()
 
            # Reinsert x, y, z in
            # priority_queue
            ans = x * y * z
             
            print(-ans)
             
            q.put(x);
            q.put(y);
            q.put(z);

if __name__ == '__main__':
  
    arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
    n = len(arr)
     
    LargestTripletMultiplication(arr, n)

Output
-1
-1
6
24
60
Time Complexity: O(N * log N ).
Auxiliary Space: O(N), N is the length of the array.
