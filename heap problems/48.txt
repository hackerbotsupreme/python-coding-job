Given an array of digits (values are from 0 to 9), find the minimum possible sum of two numbers formed from digits of the array. All digits of given array must be used to form the two numbers.

Examples: 

Input: [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]
Output: 604
The minimum sum is formed by numbers 
358 and 246

Input: [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
Output: 82
The minimum sum is formed by numbers 
35 and 047

Since we want to minimize the sum of two numbers to be formed, we must divide all digits in two halves and assign half-half digits to them. We also need to make sure that the leading digits are smaller. 

We build a Min Heap with the elements of the given array, which takes O(n) worst time. Now we retrieve min values (2 at a time) of array, by polling from the Priority Queue and append these two min values to our numbers, till the heap becomes empty, i.e., all the elements of array get exhausted. We return the sum of two formed numbers, which is our required answer. Overall complexity is O(nlogn) as push() operation takes O(logn) and itâ€™s repeated n times. 

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to find minimum
# sum of two numbers formed from
# all digits in a given array.
from queue import PriorityQueue
 
# Returns sum of two numbers formed
# from all digits in a[]
def solve(a):
     
    # min Heap
    pq = PriorityQueue()
     
    # To store the 2 numbers
    # formed by array elements to
    # minimize the required sum
    num1 = ""
    num2 = ""
 
    # Adding elements in
    # Priority Queue
    for x in a:
        pq.put(x)
 
    # Checking if the priority
    # queue is non empty
    while not pq.empty():
        num1 += str(pq.get())
        if not pq.empty():
            num2 += str(pq.get())   
 
    # The required sum calculated
    sum = int(num1) + int(num2)
     
    return sum
     
# Driver code
if __name__=="__main__":
     
    arr = [ 6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3 ]
    print("The required sum is ", solve(arr))

Another method: We can follow another approach also like this, as we need two numbers such that their sum is minimum, then we would also need two minimum numbers. If we arrange our array in ascending order then we can two digits that will form the smallest numbers, 

e.g., 2 3 4 5 6 8, now we can get two numbers starting from 2 and 3. First part is done now. Moving forward we have to form such that they would contain small digits, i.e. pick digits alternatively from array extend your two numbers. 

i.e. 246, 358. Now if we see analyze this, then we can pick even indexed numbers for num1 and an odd number for num2.

Below is the implementation:

C
Java
Python3
# Python 3 program to find minimum
# sum of two numbers formed
# from all digits in an given array
 
# Returns sum of two numbers formed
# from all digits in a[]
def minSum(a, n):
     
    # sorted the elements
    a = sorted(a)
    num1, num2 = 0, 0
     
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            num1 = num1 * 10 + a[i]
        else:
            num2 = num2 * 10 + a[i]
     
    return num2 + num1    
     
# Driver code
arr = [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
n = len(arr)
print("The required sum is",
             minSum(arr, n))
