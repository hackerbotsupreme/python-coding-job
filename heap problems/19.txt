Consider a Binary Heap of size N. We need to find the height of it.

Examples:  

Input : N = 6
Output : 2

Let the size of the heap be N and the height be h. If we take a few examples, we can notice that the value of h in a complete binary tree is floor(log2N). 

Examples:  

 N    h
---------
 1    0
 2    1
 3    1
 4    2
 5    2
 .....

Implementation: 

C++
Java
Python 3
# Python 3 program to find
# height of complete binary
# tree from total nodes.
import math
def height(N):
    return math.ceil(math.log2(N + 1)) - 1
 
# driver node
N = 6
print(height(N))

Time Complexity: O(1), Since performing constant operations.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), Since constant extra space is used.
