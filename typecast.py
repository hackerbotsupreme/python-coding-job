a="3434"
print(type(a))
a=int(a)# type casting string to int 
print (a+5)#it will give an error bccz we can not add digits with strings(notice its in double quotes)
# so we need to typeecast it first from  string to number , to do that 
print(type(a))
# note we cant always typecast bcz in this case we had int in string so typecasting has sucessful 
#but for like  string "aloke "" we cant typecast it to int 
#typecast is the way to convert one  data type to another 
#similarly, a=str(31) > integer to string conversion 
#or a =int (31), a= float(31) etc..
