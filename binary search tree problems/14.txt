Given an array of N element. The task is to check if it is Inorder traversal of any Binary Search Tree or not. Print “Yes” if it is Inorder traversal of any Binary Search Tree else print “No”. 

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = { 19, 23, 25, 30, 45 }
Output : Yes

Input : arr[] = { 19, 23, 30, 25, 45 }
Output : No

The idea is to use the fact that the inorder traversal of Binary Search Tree is sorted. So, just check if given array is sorted or not. 

Implementation:

C++
Java
Python3
# Python 3 program to check if a given array
# is sorted or not.
 
# Function that returns true if array is Inorder
# traversal of any Binary Search Tree or not.
def isInorder(arr, n):
     
    # Array has one or no element
    if (n == 0 or n == 1):
        return True
 
    for i in range(1, n, 1):
         
        # Unsorted pair found
        if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]):
            return False
 
    # No unsorted pair found
    return True
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    arr = [19, 23, 25, 30, 45]
    n = len(arr)
     
    if (isInorder(arr, n)):
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
