Bit Rotation: A rotation (or circular shift) is an operation similar to shift except that the bits that fall off at one end are put back to the other end. 
In left rotation, the bits that fall off at left end are put back at right end. 
In right rotation, the bits that fall off at right end are put back at left end.

Example: 
Let n is stored using 8 bits. Left rotation of n = 11100101 by 3 makes n = 00101111 (Left shifted by 3 and first 3 bits are put back in last ). If n is stored using 16 bits or 32 bits then left rotation of n (000…11100101) becomes 00..0011100101000. 
Right rotation of n = 11100101 by 3 makes n = 10111100 (Right shifted by 3 and last 3 bits are put back in first ) if n is stored using 8 bits. If n is stored using 16 bits or 32 bits then right rotation of n (000…11100101) by 3 becomes 101000..0011100.

# Python3 code to
# rotate bits of number
 
INT_BITS = 32
 
# Function to left
# rotate n by d bits
def leftRotate(n, d):
 
    # In n<<d, last d bits are 0.
    # To put first 3 bits of n at
    # last, do bitwise or of n<<d
    # with n >>(INT_BITS - d)
    return (n << d)|(n >> (INT_BITS - d))
 
# Function to right
# rotate n by d bits
def rightRotate(n, d):
 
    # In n>>d, first d bits are 0.
    # To put last 3 bits of at
    # first, do bitwise or of n>>d
    # with n <<(INT_BITS - d)
    return (n >> d)|(n << (INT_BITS - d)) & 0xFFFFFFFF
 
# Driver program to
# test above functions
n = 16
d = 2
 
print("Left Rotation of",n,"by"
      ,d,"is",end=" ")
print(leftRotate(n, d))
 
print("Right Rotation of",n,"by"
     ,d,"is",end=" ")

Output
Left Rotation of 16 by 2 is 64
Right Rotation of 16 by 2 is 4
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

For 16 bit number:

C++
C
Java
Python3
SHORT_SIZE = 16
 
# function to rotate the given unsigned short
# in the left direction
def leftRotate(x, d):
 
    return (x << d) | (x >> (SHORT_SIZE - d))
 
  # function to rotate the given unsigned short
# in the right direction
def rightRotate(x, d):
 
    return (x >> d) | (x << (SHORT_SIZE - d)) & 0xDDDDDF
 
# Driver program to test above functions
# Test case
n = 28
d = 2
 
print("Left Rotation of",n,"by"
      ,d,"is",end=" ")
print(leftRotate(n, d))
 
print("Right Rotation of",n,"by"
     ,d,"is",end=" ")
print(rightRotate(n, d))
