Given two numbers, the task is to check if two numbers are equal without using Arithmetic and Comparison Operators or String functions.

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1 : The idea is to use XOR operator. XOR of two numbers is 0 if the numbers are the same, otherwise non-zero. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to check if two numbers
# are equal without using arithmetic
# and comparison operators
  
def areSame(a, b):
  
# Function to check if two
# numbers are equal using 
# XOR operator
 if ((a ^ b) != 0):
    print("Not Same") 
 else:
    print("Same")
  
# Driver Code
  
areSame(10, 20)
  
# This code is contributed by Smitha
C#
PHP
Javascript
Output
Not Same
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Method 2 : Here idea is using complement ( ~ ) and bit-wise ‘&’ operator. 

C++
Java
Python3
# Python3 program to check if two numbers
# are equal without using arithmetic
# and comparison operators
  
# Function to check if two
# numbers are equal using
# using ~ complement and & operator.
  
  
def areSame(a, b):
    if ((a & ~b) == 0 and (~a & b) == 0):
        print("Same")
    else:
        print("Not Same")
  
  
# Calling function
areSame(10, 20)

Output
Not Same
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
