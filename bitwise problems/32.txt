Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32. The task is consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.
Examples : 

Input  : x = 10, y = 13, l = 2, r = 3
Output : x = 14
Binary representation of 10 is 1010 and 
that of y is 1101. There is one set bit
in y at 3'rd position (in given range). 
After we copy this bit to x, x becomes 1110
which is binary representation of 14.

Input  : x = 8, y = 7, l = 1, r = 2
Output : x = 11

Method 1 (One by one copy bits) 
We can one by one find set bits of y by traversing given range. For every set bit, we OR it to existing bit of x, so that the becomes set in x, if it was not set. Below is C++ implementation.
 

CPP
Java
Python3
# Python program to rearrange array in alternating
# Python program to copy set bits in a given
# range [l, r] from y to x.
 
# Copy set bits in range [l, r] from y to x.
# Note that x is passed by reference and modified
# by this function.
def copySetBits(x, y, l, r):
   
    # l and r must be between 1 to 32
    # (assuming ints are stored using
    # 32 bits)
    if (l < 1 or r > 32):
        return x;
 
    # Traverse in given range
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
       
        # Find a mask (A number whose
        # only set bit is at i'th position)
        mask = 1 << (i - 1);
 
        # If i'th bit is set in y, set i'th
        # bit in x also.
        if ((y & mask) != 0):
            x = x | mask;
    return x;
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = 10;
    y = 13;
    l = 1;
    r = 32;
    x = copySetBits(x, y, l, r);
    print("Modified x is ", x);

Javascript
Output
Modified x is 15
Time Complexity: O(r)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 
Method 2 (Copy all bits using one bit mask)
 



CPP
Java
Python3
# Python program to copy set bits in a given
# range [l, r] from y to x.
 
# Copy set bits in range [l, r] from y to x.
# Note that x is passed by reference and modified
# by this function.
def copySetBits(x, y, l, r):
 
    # l and r must be between 1 to 32
    if (l < 1 or r > 32):
        return x;
 
    # get the length of the mask
    maskLength = (int) ((1 << (r - l + 1)) - 1);
 
    # Shift the mask to the required position
    # "&" with y to get the set bits at between
    # l ad r in y
    mask = ((maskLength) << (l - 1)) & y;
    x = x | mask;
    return x;
 
# Driver code
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = 10;
    y = 13;
    l = 2;
    r = 3;
    x = copySetBits(x, y, l, r);
    print("Modified x is " , x);
 
# This code is contributed by gauravrajput1
C#
Javascript
Output
Modified x is 14
Time Complexity: O(1)

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
